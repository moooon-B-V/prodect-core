// fails the build with a confusing "Failed to collect page data" error on a
// route that has zero coupling to Google.
//
// Fix: seed placeholder OAuth creds here so module-load `requiredEnv` checks
// pass during dev and `next build`. This file is evaluated by `next dev`,
// `next build`, AND the production server, so the injection MUST be gated to
// non-production — otherwise a genuinely-missing prod credential would be
// silently papered over with a placeholder instead of failing loud at the
// first /api/auth request (the property finding #3 explicitly wants to keep).

// The placeholders are inert build-time stand-ins: they only let module-load
// `requiredEnv` checks pass during `next build`'s page-data collection. They
// never authenticate against Google (no OAuth round-trip happens during a
// build). Gated to non-production so a production deploy that genuinely lacks
// the creds still fails loud at the first /api/auth request.
//
// This is purely a LOCAL build-DX fix and changes nothing on Vercel: both
// Production AND Preview targets carry real GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, so the
// `??=` never overwrites anything there. The branch only fires in local
// `git worktree` / CI builds whose hand-copied `.env` omits the OAuth vars
// (the scenario in PRODECT_FINDINGS #3) — those have NODE_ENV development/test,
// get placeholders, and `next build` collects page data cleanly instead of
// throwing on routes (e.g. /api/invites/[token]/accept) that never touch Google.

/**
 * The documentation area moved from `/api-docs` to `/docs` (MOTIR-2286 · ADR
 * `public-api-conventions.md` Amendment 9 Q1), so every address it ever served
 * keeps working — PERMANENTLY.
 *
 * `permanent: true` is a 308, which is the point: a 307 tells a crawler and a
 * bookmark to keep asking the old address forever, and the whole reason the area
 * was renamed one day after it shipped is that a URL is a promise to strangers.
 *
 * The order matters. Next matches these top-to-bottom, and `/api-docs/:path*`
 * would swallow the bare `/api-docs` only if `:path*` matched empty — it does,
 * so the exact rule is declared FIRST and the reference keeps its own
 * destination (`/docs/api`) rather than landing on the area root.
 *
 * The LAST entry exists because the reference deliberately does NOT own the
 * area root: `/docs` is a directory, not a page, and a reader who trims the URL
 * should land on the reference rather than a 404. (Whether it should keep
 * landing there is Amendment 11's one recorded open question — MOTIR-2315.)
 *
 * Exported separately from `nextConfig` so `tests/api-docs/docs-redirects.test.ts`
 * can assert the map without booting a server.

  // measurement.

  // `outputFileTracingExcludes` are read in exactly one place,

  //
  // ⚠️ AMENDED 2026-08-20 (MOTIR-3219) — THE CAUSE OF THAT SWEEP, and it was

  // `docs/`, `scripts/`, `packages/cli/`, `prisma/migrations/`) because
  // `instrumentation.ts`'s E2E boundary mocks each read a fixture from a path it
  // could not resolve statically, and its fallback for an unresolvable read is to
  // trace the ENTIRE project. Marking those reads `turbopackIgnore`
  // (`lib/test-fixture-file.ts`) took `instrumentation.js.nft.json` from **4510
  // files to 168** and `.next/standalone` from **464 MB to 124 MB** — so the 381
  // MB / 324-design-files figures above are a record of the BUG, not of what a
  // Turbopack build costs.
  //
  // Two consequences for anyone re-reading this block: the paragraph above is
  // still correct that these keys are inert, so do not re-add them; and the
  // Dockerfile step no longer PRUNES — it asserts the sweep has not returned.
  // `pnpm assert:nft-trace` makes the same assertion on every pull request.

 * `outputFileTracingExcludes` above is a live example of a `next.config` key
 * this build never reads (MOTIR-2403). It was verified, and the answer is that
 * source-map upload DOES run here — by a different mechanism than the webpack
 * one most Sentry documentation describes:
 *
 *   - `next build` selects Turbopack when no bundler flag is set and sets
 *     `process.env.TURBOPACK = 'auto'` BEFORE it loads this file
 *     (`next/dist/lib/bundler.js`, called at the top of `next/dist/cli/
 *     next-build.js`), so the SDK's `detectActiveBundler()` sees `turbopack`.
 *   - On Turbopack with Next ≥ 15.4.1 — this repo is on 16.2.6 — the SDK does
 *     NOT install a webpack plugin. It sets `compiler.runAfterProductionCompile`,
 *     which Next invokes once the compile is done, and THAT injects debug ids
 *     and uploads the maps (`@sentry/nextjs`'s
 *     `getFinalConfigObjectBundlerUtils.ts` → `handleRunAfterProductionCompile.ts`).
 *
 * So the inert-key trap does not apply, and the evidence is a log line rather
 * than a reading: a build with a token prints
 * `Successfully uploaded source maps to Sentry` at info level. `ci.yml`'s deploy
 * step greps the deploy output for exactly that and FAILS the release if a
 * token was supplied and the line is absent — the same "fail loudly rather than
 * quietly stop mattering" shape the Dockerfile's standalone assertion uses,
 * and the reason this card's "demonstrated to have RUN" criterion keeps holding
 * after today.
