// GET /api/work-items/planning-anchor?key=<identifier> (MOTIR-4727) — the ANCHOR
// half of a work-item launch of the planning workspace, fetched CLIENT-side.
//
// The workspace is moving from a route to an OVERLAY mounted in the authed shell
// (MOTIR-4725). `app/(planning)/planning/page.tsx` resolved this SERVER-side —
// one `getWorkItemWithAncestors` whose result seeded three things at once: the
// conversation's `anchorId` (MOTIR-909), the pre-filled `@`-mention target
// (MOTIR-1491), and the canvas's arrival trail (MOTIR-2070), so the canvas opens
// on the anchor's OWN level. An overlay is a client island and no client
// component may reach the service layer (CLAUDE.md's 4-layer rule), so the read
// needs an HTTP door.
//
// Built in the exact shape of `app/api/work-items/peek/route.ts` (bug 8.8.2) —
// the data half of the other URL-driven modal: resolve against the actor's
// ACTIVE project, the 2FA hold AFTER the no-project arm, a thin call into the
// service, and the no-existence-leak 404.
//
// Thin HTTP over `workItemsService.getWorkItemWithAncestors` — the SAME
// view-gated lineage read the retiring page and `/roadmap?item=` already make.
// No `db` / no `$transaction` here, and no new service method.
//
// A stale / deleted / cross-workspace / forbidden key is the same 404 (never a
// 403, which would leak "it exists but you can't see it"). The overlay renders
// that as the project conversation at the root — the page's own silent-catch
// semantics, one hop over the wire.
/**
 * The three ways the read can say "there is nothing here for you" — all one
 * answer, because a 403 on any of them would say "it exists but you can't see
 * it".
 *
 * ⚠️ `ProjectNotFoundError` cannot arise from THIS call, and is kept anyway.
 * `getWorkItemWithAncestors` resolves the ITEM first, so its project exists by
 * the time `assertCanBrowse` reads it — the class is here because this handler
 * is deliberately the peek route's twin, and a leak-sensitive path is the wrong
 * place to narrow a catch on a reading of today's call graph. The invariant it
 * rests on is asserted in `tests/planning/planning-overlay-story-gate.test.ts`.
