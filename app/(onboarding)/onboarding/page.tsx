// The onboarding ENTRANCE route (Subtask 7.22.4 / MOTIR-1462) — the new-vs-existing
// fork the user lands on at `/onboarding`, designed by MOTIR-1461
// (`design/onboarding-entrance/`). It replaces the old direct render of the
// discovery chat here: the chat now lives at `/onboarding/discovery`, and this
// screen ROUTES into it (Start planning → discovery, seeded with the idea) or
// hands off to the migrate wizard (→ `/onboarding/migrate`, owned by 7.15 /
// MOTIR-934 — whose optional Import step reaches the importer at `/onboarding/import`).
//
// A Server Component that gates exactly like the discovery route (session →
// active project → the onboarding-ran marker), then reads the preserved idea
// (the motir.co hero cookie, MOTIR-1458) to pre-fill the box. It does NO AI read
// and imports nothing from `motir-ai` (the open-core invariant) — the idea
// reaches the planner only through the 7.3.4 chat route the discovery surface
// drives, after the entrance forwards to it.
//
// EXISTING-ITEM DETECTION (MOTIR-1259): a never-AI-planned project that already
// has a committed work-item tree routes directly to the migrate wizard
// (`/onboarding/migrate`) instead of showing the start-fresh entrance. Existing
// items ARE the project's understanding — the 4-tier pre-plan is skipped.
