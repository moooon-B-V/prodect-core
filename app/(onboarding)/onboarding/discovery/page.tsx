// The authed discovery onboarding route (Subtask 7.3.5 / MOTIR-833) — where the
// public front door (7.3.14) lands the visitor after auth (`ONBOARDING_ENTRY_PATH
// = /onboarding`). A Server Component that gates on session + active project (the
// established getSession + getActiveProject pattern, mirroring /ready + /items),
// READS the preserved idea (7.3.14 cookie) to seed the loop's first turn, and
// hands off to the client island that drives the FORWARD gated review loop.
//
// The loop reads its resumable state from the 7.3.70 `/api/ai/pre-plan` seam and
// streams the conductor over the 7.3.4 `/api/ai/chat` SSE, so this page does no
// AI read itself — it only resolves the actor + the seed idea. The polished
// two-pane shell (canvas roadmap + step host) is the onboarding shell, Subtask
// 7.3.11 / MOTIR-840, which composes the chat + review surfaces built here.
//
// EXISTING-ITEM DETECTION (MOTIR-1259): a never-AI-planned project that already
// has a committed work-item tree redirects to the migrate wizard
// (`/onboarding/migrate`) instead of entering the start-fresh discovery loop.
// Existing items ARE the project's understanding — the 4-tier pre-plan is skipped.
