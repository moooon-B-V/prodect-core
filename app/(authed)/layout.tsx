//                settings-area header swap. It no longer takes `projects` or
//                `aiConfigured`: the rail has no project control to feed.
//   - SidebarDrawer's header ← the same ShellTierNav at placement="drawer",
//                which carries the ANCESTORS (`org › workspace`) at every
//                width — that is where the bar's below-md band sends them.

  // These four are INDEPENDENT of each other and were four sequential round
  // trips — which is what a TYPED URL pays before any HTML body exists at all,
  // and therefore before the skeleton that is supposed to appear immediately
  // can be rendered. The boundary alone would not have answered the reported
  // case; this is why. One `Promise.all`, so the shell's own reads cost one
  // round trip instead of four:

  //                                  request-memoised helper (MOTIR-2453), so
  //                                  it is not a second validation.
  //   · listUserWorkspaces()       — the switcher's list.

  //                                  §1). A boolean crosses into the client:

  //                                  its use site below.
  //
  // Everything AFTER this point depends on `ctx` or on one of these results and

  // query changed, no index, no cache, and the shell renders exactly what it
  // rendered before.

  //                                     reader who is current, which is all of

                      (MOTIR-2763). `PlanWithAIFab` below is `fixed right-5
                      bottom-5 h-14 w-14 z-40`, so it owns the bottom-right
                      viewport rect `y ∈ [bottom−76, bottom−20]` on every screen
                      it mounts on — while participating in NO page's flow. At
                      the end of a scrolled page the last block used to land
                      inside that band, and a bottom-anchored control there
                      (the /items pager, /home's Next) stopped receiving its own
                      clicks: still perfectly visible, but the orb won the hit
                      test.

                      The reservation is made ONCE, here, at the mount that
                      creates the obstruction — not on each pager, which would
                      be a growing list every future bottom-anchored control has
                      to remember to join. It is conditional on the same
                      `showPlanWithAi` that decides whether the orb ships at all,
                      so a workspace with AI planning unconfigured pays nothing.

                      It travels as a CUSTOM PROPERTY rather than a bare padding
                      class because the surfaces that size themselves against the
                      fold have to subtract the same amount, and one of them
                      (`packages/design-system/theme.css`'s 3d-immersive board
                      column) is a stylesheet that cannot read a React prop.
                      6rem = the orb's 76px reach + a visible gap. See
                      `design/shell/design-notes.md`. */}
