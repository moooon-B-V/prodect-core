/**
 * The platform-admin route group — `docs/decisions/platform-staff-auth.md` §4.
 *
 * A sibling of `(authed)` / `(auth)` / `(public)` / `(onboarding)` /
 * `(onboarding)`, inside motir-core, because the console reuses the shipped auth,
 * the app shell, the design system and the `--el-*` / shape tokens (design
 * `console.mock.html` composes them with no bespoke admin CSS). It is operator
 * UI over motir-core's own data and holds no metering, so nothing about it
 * belongs on the closed side (Principle #19).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE GATE IS HERE, AND IT ANSWERS 404. This layout is the single choke
 * point for every page in the group: it resolves the platform principal before
 * rendering anything, and calls `notFound()` when there is none. A non-staff
 * principal — INCLUDING a workspace owner and an org owner — gets the ordinary
 * app 404, indistinguishable from a route that does not exist. There is no 403,
 * no "forbidden" body, no redirect, and no log line naming `/admin`.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND `/admin` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT FROM `proxy.ts`'s matcher (ADR §2).
 * The proxy's optimistic check REDIRECTS a cookie-less request to
 * `/sign-in?next=<path>` — a response visibly different from an unknown path's
 * 404, and therefore a proof that `/admin` is real. An anonymous request must
 * instead reach this layout and be answered here. This is the one place where
 * following the established authed-route pattern would break the posture. It
 * costs nothing: the session read below is the same one every authed page
 * already makes.
 *
 * ⚠️ A LAYOUT DOES NOT PROTECT A ROUTE HANDLER. Every `app/api/admin/**`
 * handler calls `requirePlatformStaff()` itself, and so does every
 * platform-scoped service method (§2's two-layer rule). This gate protects the
 * PAGES; it is not the only assertion.
