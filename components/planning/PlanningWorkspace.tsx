// The reusable AI planning workspace shell (introduced by Subtask 7.3.5 /
// MOTIR-833). The full-screen, two-pane frame EVERY AI-planning surface shares:
// the canvas on the LEFT, the chat rail on the RIGHT — nothing else.
//
// This is the "one planning interface" foundation (Yue, 2026-06-20): the
// canvas+chat STRUCTURE is identical across the planning surfaces; only the
// canvas content + the chat driver differ per case. Onboarding (7.3) is the
// FIRST, specialized consumer; generation review (7.4), re-planning (7.11),
// contextual planning (7.12) and the persistent roadmap (7.19) REUSE this same
// shell rather than each building their own. Presentational: it owns only the
// full-screen two-pane layout; each consumer supplies its own `canvas` + `chat`.
