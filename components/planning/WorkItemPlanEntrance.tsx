// The PER-ITEM Plan / Re-plan entrance (Subtask MOTIR-910; design
// `design/work-items/plan-replan-entrance.mock.html` panels 1–4). The contextual
// door that sits ON a work item — the detail page header's right cluster and the
// quick-view / peek modal's header bar — opening the SHIPPED universal planning
// workspace scoped to that item.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a second `PlanWithAILauncher`: the launcher is the
// GLOBAL hero pill in `TopNav` ("plan something"), while this is a quiet,
// per-item affordance sitting among the item's own controls. Both resolve their
// href through the same `useOpenPlanningWorkspace`, so there is exactly one
// entry path into the workspace and one place that decides the mode.
//
// ⚠️ IT OPENS AN OVERLAY IN PLACE NOW (MOTIR-4730), which changes what the peek
// does. See `onActivate` below: the quick view used to close as this pill was
// clicked, because the workspace was a ROUTE and the peek was about to be
// unmounted anyway. The design settled the dialog-over-dialog case the other
// way — the workspace opens ABOVE the peek and `?peek=` stays in the address, so
// closing the workspace returns the reader to the open quick view they launched
// from, which is the literal reading of "back to exactly where you were".
//
// TWO FACES (design "Modes"), and WHICH one it wears is decided by the shared
// Plan / Re-plan rule (`planEntranceFace`, MOTIR-2097) — for a CONTAINER by
// whether it has children, for a LEAF by whether it has a description:
//   * Plan    — nothing to re-plan yet. Accent-outlined pill; the workspace
//               opens and the AI starts from the item's own description. No
//               opening reason.
//   * Re-plan — there IS an existing plan (a container's children, a leaf's
//               description). Subdued pill (it is an EDIT of existing work); the
//               workspace opens with the composer asking what's wrong, and the
//               user's first chat turn IS the reason (MOTIR-908 classifies the
//               intent from it — there is no reason param).
//
// Colour flows through `--el-*` and shape through the element-semantic tokens, so
// the pill re-skins with `data-palette` and re-shapes with `data-style`. It is a
// real `<Link>`: keyboard-reachable, middle/⌘-clickable, and (from the peek)
// `onActivate` hands off by closing the modal first.
//
// BOTH decisions — whether it renders and which face it wears — are made HERE
// from the item state its host hands it, by the shared rule (`planEntranceFace`,
// MOTIR-2084 + MOTIR-2097). The component applies the rule itself, so it travels
// with the component instead of being re-derived — and re-missed — at each call
// site. The state props are REQUIRED for exactly that reason: a new host cannot
// mount the door without stating the item's plannability.

// ── THE PER-SURFACE DOORS THIS ONE REPLACED, and why (the breadcrumb) ──────
// This note lived in `PlanEditsLauncher.tsx` until MOTIR-4258 deleted that file;
// it moved HERE because this is the surviving door, and so the place a person
// asking "why is there only one?" actually arrives.
//
//   * The one-shot `AugmentPromptButton` — a toolbar `Button` → `Modal` with a
//     single `Input` → `POST /api/ai/augment` — was RETIRED by MOTIR-1731.
//     Changing a plan is a CONVERSATION, so the entrance is the universal
//     Plan-with-AI workspace (the global `TopNav` pill / ⌘K / the floating orb),
//     never a per-surface button with no way to refine. See
//     `design/ai-chat/design-notes.md` ("the retired 'Augment from prompt'
//     door", MOTIR-1727) panel 5.
//   * The `/items` row ⋯ menu's `Expand` / `Re-plan` rows — which opened the
//     IN-PLACE plan-edits dock rather than the workspace — went the same way in
//     MOTIR-4258, when the row's ⋯ was removed. They were the last per-surface
//     plan control, and the fact that they read THIS file's rule while opening a
//     different flow is what MOTIR-2097 had already been filed about.
//
// In both cases the JOB PATH is untouched — only the door went. `/api/ai/augment`
// is driven by the conversation; `/api/ai/expand` by `/ready`'s expansion nudge.
// `/api/ai/replan` is the one left with no caller, and that is MOTIR-4261.
