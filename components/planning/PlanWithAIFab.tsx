/**
 * PlanWithAIFab — the floating Motir orb, the universal AI callout's TRIGGER
 * (MOTIR-1299 / Story 7.20; MOTIR-1812 / Story 7.24. Design @
 * `design/ai-chat/ai-callout-menu.mock.html`). A glowing orb afloat
 * bottom-right on every screen — the second of the two entrances the design
 * ships (alongside the header pill, `PlanWithAILauncher`).
 *
 * It used to navigate STRAIGHT to the planning workspace; as its own note
 * promised, it has now "grown a menu in place". The orb is a `<button>` inside
 * `Popover.Trigger`, and *Plan with AI* is the first ROW of the callout
 * (`AiCalloutMenu`) — so the orb's accessible name is the callout's, "Motir
 * AI", and "Plan with AI" names the row inside. Every shipped visual is
 * unchanged: the same fill, glow, pulse, position, z-index and transitions.
 *
 * The one-click path is NOT lost — the TopNav hero pill and ⌘K still go
 * straight to the workspace from every screen — as an OVERLAY on the page they
 * are on since MOTIR-4725 — and the rows are real links, so
 * ⌘/middle-click survives one level in.
 *
 * Wears the Motir mark (MOTIR-3185) at the 26px glyph box the design
 * specifies for the 56px circle — composed from `BrandMark`, never inlined.
 * Palette-derived throughout (the orb fill + glow are `color-mix()` over
 * `--el-*`, never raw hex); the orb is genuinely circular (`rounded-full`).
 * Sits at `z-40` — below toasts / modals / the command palette (`z-50`), which
 * may transiently cover it.
 *
 * Gating is the MOUNT's job (rendered only where AI planning is configured +
 * there's a project to plan into), like the header pill.
 *
 * ── DRAGGABLE, AND THROWABLE (MOTIR-3214) ───────────────────────────────────
 * The orb can be dragged anywhere on screen, and a hard flick throws it: it
 * carries its release velocity, bounces off the viewport edges and settles. The
 * physics is `lib/planning/orbPhysics.ts` (pure) and the wiring is
 * `lib/hooks/useDraggableOrb.ts`; this component only supplies the element.
 *
 * Three behaviours worth knowing before editing:
 *   * A press that does not MOVE still opens the callout — the drag threshold is
 *     4 px, and past it the click that the browser fires on release is swallowed
 *     in the capture phase so a throw does not also open the panel.
 *   * The position is NOT persisted. A new tab puts the orb back in its default
 *     corner; it survives client-side navigation only because this component is
 *     mounted by the layout and never unmounts.
 *   * `prefers-reduced-motion` skips the THROW, not the drag: the orb still goes
 *     wherever it is put, it just does not fly there.
 *   * A MOVING orb CLOSES the callout (MOTIR-3226). The panel is a popover
 *     anchored to this button, so an open one rode the drag across the page and
 *     then stranded ~818px away mid-throw — Radix's `PopperContent` re-anchors on
 *     scroll/resize and an IntersectionObserver, none of which a per-frame
 *     `translate` fires. Hiding it is what was asked for, and it is also the only
 *     answer that does not put a menu on a flying orb. It does NOT re-open at
 *     rest: the release click is swallowed, so the user asked for nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND ONE RULE ABOUT THIS ELEMENT'S CLASSES (MOTIR-3214). The hook writes the
 * orb's position into the `translate` property every animation frame. So:
 *   * NOTHING here may transition `translate` — `transition-transform` in Tailwind
 *     v4 is `transition-property: transform, translate, scale, rotate`, and with it
 *     on, a 150ms ease fought the frame loop for the whole flight and the orb
 *     reversed ~350px short of the wall it was meant to bounce off. The scale is
 *     eased on its own instead.
 *   * NOTHING here may write `translate` or `transform` as a utility — the hover
 *     and press scales are safe only because `scale` composes independently of
 *     `translate`; a `translate-x-*` utility would silently fight the drag.
