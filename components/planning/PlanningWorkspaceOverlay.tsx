// THE PLANNING WORKSPACE OVERLAY (MOTIR-4729, under story MOTIR-4725) — the
// workspace as a full-screen layer over whatever authed page is open, which is
// what `design/ai-chat/design-notes.md` § *Opening & exiting — a full-screen
// overlay ON TOP of the app (sheet 6)* has specified since MOTIR-1193 and what
// the `(planning)` ROUTE could not be.
//
// ⚠️ THE OPEN STATE IS THE ADDRESS, AND IS HELD NOWHERE ELSE. It is open when
// `parsePlanningOverlay` finds the overlay's four namespaced parameters in the
// query (MOTIR-4728), and it closes by writing them away. `RunsIndex.tsx`
// derives `openRunId` the same way, and the property is what buys the two things
// this story promises for free: **browser Back closes it** (a `popstate` changes
// what `useSearchParams` reports, and no code has to notice), and no second
// source of truth can ever disagree with the address bar.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS THE SHIPPED `Modal`, NOT A HAND-ROLLED OVERLAY. Focus trapping, the
// Escape key and focus RETURN are the parts of an overlay that go wrong quietly,
// and the product has paid to get them right once. `size="full"` +
// `rounded-none border-0 p-0` is the EDGE-TO-EDGE composition the design
// measured and chose over an inset (it would cost the canvas 48px in each axis
// at every viewport, on the surface with the most canvas need); `hideClose`
// suppresses the dialog's own corner ✕, because the host renders its Close
// top-left and two Closes in one dialog is a question the reader should never be
// asked.
//
// ⚠️ THE ORB SITS BEHIND THE SCRIM, and it needs no code. `PlanWithAIFab` is
// `fixed … z-40`; `Dialog.Overlay` is `fixed inset-0 z-40` and is PORTALLED, so
// it comes later in the document and wins the tie — the orb is dimmed and inert
// with the rest of the app, which is what "the app stays mounted, dimmed +
// inert, behind it" means. `Dialog.Content` is `z-50`, above both. The run modal
// lands in exactly the same place for the same reason.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY CLOSE GOES THROUGH `requestClose()`. Close, Escape, the scrim and the
// history pop all land on that one function, because the close-with-pending
// guard (MOTIR-4731) intercepts exactly it. The seam is the deliverable; the
// behaviour behind it is that card's.
//
// ── What the ROUTE did on the server, this does in the browser ──────────────
//
//   session + 2FA + re-consent  → inherited: `app/(authed)/layout.tsx` runs both
//                                 ahead of `children`, and this is a child.
//   the active project           → props, from the layout that already has it.
//   canBrowse / the admin gate   → `useProjectAccess()`. The provider IS mounted
//                                 in `(authed)`, which is the whole reason the
//                                 page had to pass `canManage` by prop.
//   `resolvePlanningHostGate`    → reused as-is (it is pure).
//   the anchor + its ancestors   → `fetchPlanningAnchor` over HTTP (MOTIR-4727),
//                                 because a client island may not reach a service.
//
// ── PAGE STATE AFTER A MUTATION (`motir-core/CLAUDE.md`) ────────────────────
// An approve commits work items, so the page BEHIND the overlay is stale the
// moment the reader closes it. The host already does both halves for its own
// surfaces — `router.refresh()` for the server-rendered ones and a `treeVersion`
// tick for the canvas, which is a client island seeded once. The host page
// underneath gets the SAME split and it is not this component's to bump: a
// backlog's `IssueTreeTable` and a board's `BoardContainer` are islands that
// watch `CreateIssueProvider.issuesChangedAt`, so a story that has the overlay
// commit work items behind an open board owes that tick. Nothing here seeds them,
// and `router.refresh()` alone will not reach them.
