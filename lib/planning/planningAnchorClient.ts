// is scoped to, plus its ancestor chain.
//
// The overlay (MOTIR-4725) is a client island, so the lineage read the retiring
// `app/(planning)/planning/page.tsx` made on the server has to happen over the
// wire. This is the CLIENT half — the reusable asset, beside `roadmapClient.ts`'s
// `fetchRoadmapLevel`; a consumer calls this, never the route path.
//
// Deliberately NOT best-effort in the way `fetchRoadmapLevel` is. That read
// degrades every failure to an empty level because a canvas with no rows is a
// usable canvas. Here the two outcomes are different findings and the consumer
// treats them differently: a `404` is the no-existence-leak contract answering
// "there is no anchor you may see" and the workspace opens the project
// conversation at the root with no error surface, while a 500 or a dropped
// connection is a real failure the caller may want to retry or report. Folding
// them together would make an outage look like a missing work item.
