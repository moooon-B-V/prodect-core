// ⚠️ THE LEGACY TABLE — read `docs/decisions/token-permissions.md`
// (Story MOTIR-2572 · Subtask MOTIR-2573/-2574, 2026-08-10).
//
// This module used to define the LIVE capability vocabulary for an API token:
// six `TokenScope` values, a `TOOL_SCOPES` map over every MCP tool, a default
// grant and the CLI's fixed grant. All four are gone. A token now GRANTS
// `PermissionKey`s from `lib/permissions/catalog.ts`; the model lives in
// `lib/tokens/grant.ts` and the tool map in `lib/mcp/toolPermissions.ts`.
//
// What remains here is the FORWARD MAP for the six strings already sitting in
// `api_token.scopes` rows, and the type that keys it. `TokenScope` is that key
// type and nothing else: it is not a live vocabulary, and NOTHING NEW may be
// typed against it.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE @deprecated BLOCK AT THE FOOT OF THIS FILE IS SCAFFOLDING ────────
// Retiring the four old exports and re-pointing their consumers cannot happen in
// one commit without collapsing MOTIR-2575 / -2576 / -2577 / -2579 / -2580 /
// -2581 / -2583 into this one — every card in the story reads one of them. So
// they survive as `@deprecated` re-exports, each naming the CARD that deletes it,
// and the tree typechecks at every commit on the way. The last card to leave
// removes the block; MOTIR-2585's guard then asserts no live import of the
// retired vocabulary survives outside this legacy table. If you are reading this
// on `main` after MOTIR-2572 merged, the block should not exist — that it does is
// a finding, not a convention.
//
// ── The superseded statement, quoted so the reversal reads as a reversal ────
// The header this file carried until MOTIR-2573 said:
//
//   Per-token SCOPES — the capability boundary for an API token (Story 7.7 ·
//   Subtask 7.7.16). A scope decides which MCP operations a given token may
//   perform; it NARROWS (never widens) the token owner's existing 6.4
//   workspace/project role. The two compose at dispatch (7.7.17): an operation
//   is allowed only if the token's role permits it AND the token carries the
//   scope it maps to.
//
//   "scopes", NOT "permissions" — the durable industry convention for API-token
//   capabilities (GitHub classic-PAT *scopes*, Linear/Slack/Atlassian-OAuth
//   *scopes*). Motir already uses "permissions" for the project access model — a
//   named catalog in `lib/permissions/catalog.ts` that each role holds a SET over
//   (MOTIR-2255) — so reusing that word here would collide. The two axes COMPOSE
//   and never merge: a permission says what the token's owner may do, a scope
//   narrows what this particular token may do on their behalf.
//
// It rested on a premise that expired — that the catalog was a project-access
// model too narrow to describe what a token reaches — and the ADR records why,
// with dates. The COMPOSITION rule in the first paragraph survives verbatim and
// is restated in `lib/tokens/grant.ts`; only the naming claim is retired. No
// card may cite the paragraph above as current.

/**
 * The FORWARD MAP (ADR §5) — what each stored legacy scope confers, expressed
 * in the permission vocabulary. Applied when a token is READ; nothing rewrites
 * a row and no migration runs.
 *
 * Each entry is the set of permissions that scope's OPERATIONS assert, taken
 * from `lib/mcp/toolPermissions.ts`:
 *
 *   * `read` — every read bottoms out in `assertCanBrowse`.
 *   * `work_items:write` — its tools split FOUR ways once the real gates are
 *     named: the work-item writes (`work_item:edit`), `add_comment`
 *     (`comment:add`), the four planning submits (`ai:plan`), and — since
 *     MOTIR-2988 — `add_plan_items` (`ai:view_plan`). Expanding to all of them
 *     is what keeps an existing token working; the SPLIT is what lets a NEW
 *     token withhold planning, commenting or plan authoring.
 *
 *     ⚠️ `ai:view_plan` joined 2026-08-18 because `add_plan_items` is the first
 *     MCP tool to assert it, and this map must confer whatever `TOOL_SCOPES`
 *     files under a scope or a legacy row silently loses a tool
 *     (`tests/tokens/story-gate.test.ts` asserts exactly that). It confers no
 *     other reach over MCP: neither `approvePlan` nor `declinePlan` is an MCP
 *     tool, so the widening is one tool wide HERE.
 *
 *     ⚠️ AMENDED 2026-08-19 (MOTIR-3021): "not token-reachable at all" is no
 *     longer true of `approvePlan`. It has a bounded `/api/v1` entrance —
 *     `POST /api/v1/work-items/{key}/plan-approval` — which an operator's
 *     `motir auto --auto-approve-replan` drives. It is NOT an MCP tool,
 *     deliberately (`docs/decisions/run-findings-protocol.md` Q2), so the
 *     sentence above stays correct about this map and wrong only about the API
 *     as a whole. `declinePlan` remains unreachable by any token.
 *
 *     ⚠️ AMENDED AGAIN 2026-08-20 (MOTIR-3188), and the two amendments met at a
 *     merge. The 3021 note said that entrance is "gated by this same key". It is
 *     not any more: the plan DECISIONS moved to `ai:decide_plan`, so the route
 *     declares that one and this legacy map cannot confer it at all — no legacy
 *     scope expands to a key no MCP tool asserts. So a legacy token's reach over
 *     approval is now zero by CONSTRUCTION rather than by the absence of a
 *     route, which is the stronger of the two reasons and survives the next
 *     entrance somebody adds. What a legacy `work_items:write` still confers is
 *     `ai:view_plan`, i.e. plan AUTHORING and nothing else.
 *   * `work_items:archive` / `work_items:delete` — the two-scope split is BACK,
 *     and each maps to the key its own operations now assert.
 *
 *     ⚠️ AMENDED 2026-08-26 (MOTIR-3629). This entry used to read: "both archive
 *     and delete assert `work_item:delete`, so the old two-scope split has no
 *     counterpart in the gates." It was true and it was the evidence: a legacy
 *     vocabulary carrying a distinction the new one could not express is a
 *     missing term announcing itself, and `work_item:archive` is that term. So
 *     `work_items:archive` expands to `work_item:archive` alone, which RESTORES
 *     what that string meant when it was minted — a token that could hide a row
 *     and not destroy a tree. That is a NARROWING of a stored row, which is
 *     always legal here; the direction stale data may never take is WIDER.
 *
 *     `work_items:delete` keeps `work_item:delete`, and its holder keeps
 *     archiving: `PERMISSION_IMPLICATIONS` confers archive from delete at
 *     resolution, so nothing minted under either string lost an operation. This
 *     also closes the second half of ADR §5's accepted merge — the
 *     archive → delete direction, where a token granted only the recoverable
 *     operation had silently gained the irreversible one.
 *   * `sprints:write` — `assertCanManageSprints` / `assertCanGroom`.
 *   * `integration` — `markIntegrated` / `completeSession` reach
 *     `applyStatusTransition → assertCanEdit`, the same gate `transition_status`
 *     reaches.
 *
 * ⚠️ `integration` and `work_items:write` therefore MERGE at `work_item:edit`,
 * and that is the one place the forward map does not preserve exactly. ADR §5
 * states the direction (each gains the other's operations), why it is accepted
 * (no catalog key is added in this story, `∩ role` still caps both, and no
 * irreversible operation is reached), and that neither shipped default grant has
 * the shape that would expose it.
