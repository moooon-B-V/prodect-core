// Named `projectRepoRepository` (for the Prisma model `ProjectRepo`) so it is
// unambiguous next to the long-shipped `projectRepository`, which is the
// data-access leaf for the `project` table — a different entity. The
// repository-name-matches-the-entity rule, with the collision resolved by the
// model name rather than by filing rows under the wrong leaf.
//
// Writes require `tx` (a compile-time guarantee they run in a transaction); reads
// take an optional `tx` so a transition's locked re-read joins the surrounding
// transaction. No business logic, no transactions, no DTO mapping — those belong
// in `projectRepoSetService`.
//
// Every tenant path runs under an active workspace context, so the RLS policy's
// `app.workspace_id` GUC gates the rows; the `workspaceId` argument on each read
// is the belt-and-suspenders app-level scope (a cross-tenant id returns null →
// 404, never 403 — the no-existence-leak posture).
