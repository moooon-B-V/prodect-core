// The 2FA ENFORCEMENT GATE (Story MOTIR-1215 · Subtask MOTIR-3648).
//
// One helper, four call sites — `app/(authed)`, `app/(onboarding)`,
// and `app/(admin)`. (`app/(planning)` was a fourth until MOTIR-4732 retired the
// route group — the planning workspace is an overlay inside `(authed)` now, so it
// inherits that group's gate rather than running its own.) Copies of the same
// three lines are how
// one route group quietly stays open, so
// `tests/navigation/two-factor-gate-coverage.test.ts` enumerates the route-group
// layouts from the filesystem and fails when one neither calls this nor appears
// on its exemption list with a reason.
//
// ⚠️ IT RUNS AFTER `getSession()` AND BEFORE ANYTHING TENANT-SCOPED, and in the
// layouts' existing concurrent wave rather than as a fifth sequential round trip
// — this executes on every signed-in page load in the product, and the wave it
// joins is itself a documented performance fix (MOTIR-3433).
