// The ORGANISATION-settings navigation REGISTRY (Story MOTIR-4669 · MOTIR-4710).
//
// The third and last of Motir's settings tiers to become an AREA.
// `settings/project/` and `settings/account/` each had an area layout, a
// registry and a `SidebarNav` branch; `settings/organization/` had none of the
// three. It was a single page of section cards whose four sub-routes were
// reachable ONLY from the `OrgControl` pop-over — and `SidebarNav`'s bottom
// `Settings` row points at that page whenever no project is active, so people
// DID arrive, at a page naming none of them.
//
// Two out of three establish a pattern strongly enough that the third reads as a
// convention. It was a GAP. Yue, on the design that finally asked where the door
// was:
//
//   "now organization -> setting goes to a single page with left nav setting
//    highlighted, the same setting nav as the project setting. you didn't make
//    it clear in the design where the door is"
//
// The design of record is `design/org-admin/org-admin.mock.html` panels 7a–7d
// (MOTIR-4673), which draws the rail, both filtered arms, and this table.
//
// Like its two siblings, one source drives the surfaces that therefore cannot
// drift: the area rail, and the route ↔ registry TOTALITY test
// (`tests/settings/organizationSettingsNav.test.ts`).
//
// ⚠️ TWO SURFACES, NOT THREE — the COMMAND PALETTE is deliberately not wired
// here yet, and saying so is the point. `AppCommandPalette` already carries
// hand-written org actions (`nav-settings`, `nav-org-security`) with their own
// conditions; generating a group from this registry would either duplicate them
// or silently re-decide when they appear, which is a palette decision rather
// than a registry one. The account registry drives its palette group because it
// had none to reconcile with. Wiring this one means retiring those two actions
// in the same change.
//
// ── ⚠️ WHERE IS THE `Git` ROW? ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// Panel 7 draws `Git` in the `general` group and it is NOT here, deliberately.
// `/settings/organization/git` does not exist yet — MOTIR-4680 builds it — and
// `accountSettingsNav.ts` records what happens when a row is added ahead of its
// pane: the "reserved slot" mechanism it used for three entries was RETIRED
// (MOTIR-4324) once the last one flipped, leaving a flag, a rail branch and a
// filter unreachable from the product. Every account row since has landed in the
// SAME COMMIT as its route, which keeps the totality test green by construction.
// MOTIR-4680 adds the `Git` entry beside its page. This card builds the room the
// row will hang in, not a row pointing at a corridor.
//
// ── ⚠️ WHAT THIS REGISTRY DOES *NOT* DECIDE ─────────────────────────────────
// Nothing moves. The four existing sub-routes become rows and the index becomes
// the `Organisation` row; no page's content changes. `WorkspaceFoldInSection` in
// particular stays on the index page — below the workspace-tier reveal that page
// hosts TWO tiers' sections (`docs/decisions/organization-tier.md` §6d) and
// relocating them is a §6 decision this card has no mandate for. The registry
// filters ROWS; the index page keeps its own per-SECTION gating, untouched.
//
// Pure data + pure helpers (no JSX, no React state), so it is importable from
// both the server (the totality test) and the client (SidebarNav, the palette).
// `icon` is the lucide COMPONENT; the consumer renders `<entry.icon />`.
