// The runner-FLEET ENTRY POINT (Story MOTIR-1916 · MOTIR-1920) — turning a
// `workflow_job` `queued` delivery into an attributed provisioning intent, or,
// far more often, into a deliberate no-op.
//
// `docs/decisions/ci-minutes-allowance.md`'s 2026-07-31 amendment moves project
// CI onto Motir-operated ephemeral runners. A job that wants one announces
// itself by queueing; this service decides whether that job is OURS to serve and
// records the request durably so MOTIR-1921 can boot a machine for it.
//
// ⚠️ IT BOOTS NOTHING AND SPENDS NOTHING. No runner is registered, no token is
// minted, no cap is consulted, no credit is read — those are MOTIR-1921's and
// MOTIR-1922's, and the seam between them is exactly ONE read:
// `ciRunnerProvisioningIntentRepository.listPending`.
//
// The pipeline, and where each step is decided:
//
//   1. Is it OURS?      §O   — the requested LABELS name the Motir runner. The
//                              whole point of the card; everything else is
//                              dropped at debug level, without an error.
//   2. Whom for?        §5.2 — repo → project-repo row → project → workspace →
//                              org, the same chain the meter walks.
//   3. Already seen?    §5.8 — a cheap pre-check; the unique index is the guard.
//   4. Record it.              One insert. That is the deliverable.
