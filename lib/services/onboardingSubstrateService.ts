// THE ONBOARDING SUBSTRATE READ (Story MOTIR-4753 · MOTIR-4756).
//
// One answer to *"what does this project already have?"*, for the two callers
// that need it and neither of which could get it before:
//
//  - THE ENTRANCE ROUTER (`app/(onboarding)/onboarding/page.tsx`), which asked
//    HALF the question. It read `countProjectIssues` and handed it to
//    `shouldRouteToMigrateWizard`, whose first line was `if (itemCount <= 0)
//    return false` — there was no repository input anywhere in that predicate.
//    So a project with a connected, indexed repository and zero work items fell
//    through to the start-fresh entrance, and start-fresh discovery is not
//    code-grounded (`MIGRATE_DISCOVERY_PROMPT` is passed only by the migrate
//    wizard). That user's codebase — the best evidence Motir will ever have
//    about what they are building — went unopened for the whole journey.
//  - THE STEP MACHINE, which is about to ask whether the substrate answers
//    `discovery`'s own questions (the sibling this card unblocks).
//
// ⚠️ IT REPORTS; IT JUDGES NOTHING. Whether this substrate is ENOUGH is the
// planner's judgement (motir-ai, MOTIR-4758), and whether a step may be skipped
// is the step machine's. This module answers a question of fact and stops there.
//
// Layered per `CLAUDE.md`: a service composing EXISTING repository reads and
// `resolveCodeContext`. No Prisma outside a repository, and no new query — the
// connection half is `resolveCodeContext`'s and the indexed half is the same
// `job_run` ledger read the wizard's INDEX step already waits on.
