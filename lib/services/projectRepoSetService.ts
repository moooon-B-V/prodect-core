// The project's REPOSITORY SET — reads and writes (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1780),
// specified by `docs/decisions/project-repository-set.md`.
//
// SCOPE, deliberately narrow. This service owns the SET as data: propose rows,
// edit them, order them, move each through the ADR §4.1 establish machine, record
// which `GithubRepo` realizes each, and answer "which repo names may an item in
// this project be pinned to?". It does NOT:
//
//   * create anything on GitHub — that is the creation primitive (MOTIR-1781),
//     which calls `markCreating` → `attachRealizedRepo` / `markFailed` around its
//     own network work. Repo creation is a side effect OUTSIDE any transaction
//     (ADR §4.2 + the side-effects-outside-tx rule), which is exactly why the
//     state machine is exposed as separate short transactions rather than one
//     method that would have to hold a row locked across a GitHub round-trip;
//   * DERIVE the set's contents from a plan (which roles, which names) — that is
//     MOTIR-1881, which writes `proposed` rows THROUGH `addRow`;
//   * render anything — that is MOTIR-1782;
//   * re-point `resolveCodeContext` / `codeGraphIndexService` from workspace scope
//     to project scope. This card makes the association EXIST; adopting it is
//     MOTIR-1754's behaviour change. See the comments at both sites.
//
// TRANSACTIONS + RLS: every path opens `withWorkspaceContext`, which is what binds
// the `app.workspace_id` GUC the `project_repository` policy reads (and, for the
// joined realized repo, the `github_repo` policy). One service method = one
// transaction, and every validation read that GATES a write happens inside that
// same transaction (`db.$transaction` is what `withWorkspaceContext` opens), so a
// concurrent editor cannot slip between the guard and the write.
//
// ACCESS: reads are browse-gated, writes edit-gated, both through
// `projectAccessService` — the project's own access policy, no second rule here.
