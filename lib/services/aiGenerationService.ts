// seam between the planning workspace and the motir-ai `generate_tree` handler
// (7.4.2 · MOTIR-844), built ON the 7.21 Plan substrate (MOTIR-1336): generation
// EMITS `add` PlanItem PROPOSALS into a `Plan`; nothing materializes here — a real
// work-item tree appears only when the user APPROVES the plan (7.21 approve/
// materialize). motir-core owns NO planning logic: it opens the Plan, submits the
// job (the 7.1.5 client mints the §4b job-scoped read-back token internally),
// relays the job's SSE stream to the browser, and exposes the internal append seam
// the handler calls back into. The browser reaches motir-ai ONLY through this
// service + its routes (the open-core invariant — the client is `server-only`).
//
// Plan ↔ job binding: the Plan's `sourceJobId` is set to the submitted jobId at
// `createPlan`, so the internal seam resolves "the job's Plan" from the jobId the
// handler already holds — no planId threading through motir-ai, no JobContextBag
// change. The lookup is workspace-scoped, so a job token for one tenant can never
// append to another's plan (NoPlanForJobError → 404, the no-leak posture).
//
// 4-layer (CLAUDE.md): this service orchestrates `plansService` (the 7.21 owner of
// the Plan transactions + grammar/ref validation) + `planRepository` for the
// job→plan read; it re-uses `addProposals`' invariants rather than re-implementing
// them. The routes are thin transports over these methods.
