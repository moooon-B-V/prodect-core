// The repo-CREATION primitive (Story MOTIR-1775 · MOTIR-1781) — the service that
// makes a project's planned repositories actually exist.
//
// It is orchestration and nothing else. The three things it composes are all
// shipped, and it adds code to none of them:
//
//   * `projectRepoSetService` owns the rows and the ADR §4.1 state machine
//     (`markCreating` → `attachRealizedRepo` / `markFailed`), each its own short,
//     row-locked transaction.
//   * `repoProvisioningClient` owns every GitHub mechanic (which endpoint, which
//     credential, the 422 collision signal, readiness). It is the boundary the
//     tests fake.
//   * `githubInstallationService.persistProvisionedRepo` + `enqueueCodeGraphIndex`
//     are the shipped mirror-and-index chain. Nothing here re-implements them,
//     and nothing subscribes to a new webhook.
//
// ⚠️ NO TRANSACTION SPANS THE HOST CALLS (ADR §4.2 + the side-effects-outside-tx
// rule). Creating a repository is a network side effect that cannot be rolled
// back — you cannot un-create a repository, and a compensating delete would mean
// destroying something the user can already see to make a report look tidy. So
// each row's outcome is PERSISTED AS IT RESOLVES, and a crash mid-set leaves a
// readable partial state that the next run resumes from.
//
// ⚠️ ROWS ARE INDEPENDENT AND CREATION IS SEQUENTIAL. A failed row lands in
// `failed` WITH ITS REASON and its siblings keep their own outcomes — row 2 of 3
// failing neither rolls back row 1 nor stops row 3. Sequential rather than
// parallel because the governing limit is GitHub's 80 content-generating requests
// per minute plus an undisclosed abuse limit on repository creation specifically
// (spike §4.1): a set is 2–5 rows, so serialising costs seconds and removes the
// only way this path could ever trip a secondary limit.
//
// SCOPE. This is the primitive as a SERVICE, callable from the approval flow.
// No UI (MOTIR-1782), no schema (MOTIR-1780), no proposal (MOTIR-1881), no
// starter registry (MOTIR-709), no transfer flow (MOTIR-711).
//
// CONNECT-EXISTING is deliberately absent: it creates nothing, so it is a row
// state change plus an association — `projectRepoSetService.attachRealizedRepo`
// on an already-connected `GithubRepo`, which is shipped and which MOTIR-1782
// calls directly. Wrapping it here would add a layer that does nothing.
