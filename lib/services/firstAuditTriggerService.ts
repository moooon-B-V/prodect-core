// THE FIRST-AUDIT TRIGGER (MOTIR-2266) — a repo whose code-graph index has just
// SUCCEEDED and that has no derived audit gets its `code_audit` +
// `propose_convention` pair, once. The implementation of
// `docs/decisions/audit-on-first-index.md` (option B, accepted 2026-08-05).
//
// The asymmetry it closes: connecting a repo gives it a code graph automatically
// (`enqueueReposMissingFirstIndex`) and never gives it an assessment, so a repo
// with a graph and no audit is one the planner reasons about without knowing how
// its code is written — invisible at exactly the moment it costs something.
//
// FOUR PROPERTIES, and each is load-bearing:
//
//  1. THE GATE IS "HAS NO AUDIT YET", NEVER "IS THIS INDEX ROW NEW". That is the
//     same shape `enqueueReposMissingFirstIndex` uses against the succeeded-index
//     ledger, and it is what makes this safe to hang off EVERY index completion
//     rather than off a once-in-the-product's-life event. MOTIR-1961 paid for the
//     other reading on the indexing half: gating on row novelty left every repo
//     connected before the feature shipped permanently un-indexable, because such
//     a repo is never "new" again at any moment when the code exists.
//
//  2. IT IS REPO-SCOPED, via MOTIR-2247's `reaudit({ repoKeys })`. The unscoped
//     call fans out over the whole connected set, so learning about a sixth repo
//     would cost six derivations — the precise defect MOTIR-2244 exists to remove.
//     This fires exactly one pair, for the repo that just finished indexing.
//
//  3. IT IS PER PROJECT, because an audit is. The index fans out over EVERY
//     project of the repo's workspace (`codeGraphIndexService`'s TENANCY note) and
//     motir-ai keys a code audit on (project, repo), so a graph landing in three
//     projects' stores is three separate "does this repo have an audit" questions.
//     Deriving only the first would leave the others in exactly the state this
//     card exists to end.
//
//  4. IT NEVER FAILS, RETRIES OR SLOWS THE INDEX. A derivation blip must not turn
//     an index that SUCCEEDED into a failed run — the ledger's `succeeded` row is
//     what tells the enqueue gate and the onboarding wizard the repo has a graph.
//     So every path is best-effort + logged, mirroring `migrateOnboardingService`'s
//     `audit_convention` kick (`:205`), and a repo left un-audited is precisely the
//     state MOTIR-2244's planning-workspace nudge already exists to report. The exception
//     path is built; this only makes it the exception.
//
// THE ACTOR IS THE WORKSPACE OWNER — the `autoPlanCadenceService.runForProject`
// precedent, for its reasons. `refreshCodeAudit` mints a job-scoped read-back
// token for a specific `userId` so motir-ai reads only what that user could, and
// an index job carries no session. The owner is the only durable owner identity
// in the schema (`Project` has no `ownerId`) and holds access to every project in
// the workspace. NOT the system principal: `lib/ai/systemPrincipal.ts` is a member
// of the META workspace only and is not a member of a customer workspace at all.
//
// OUT OF SCOPE, deliberately (decision record §4): re-firing when a repo is
// RE-indexed after new commits is a genuinely recurring-spend question the record
// does not answer, which is why this hangs off `system.code-graph-index` and not
// off the shared `runIndexFleetSteps` that `system.code-graph-refresh` also drives.
// And there is no project setting: §6 records what would reopen that.
