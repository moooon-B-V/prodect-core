  /**
   * Add a user to the ORG with an org role — plus, at EXACTLY ONE workspace, that
   * workspace's membership (6.10.2 §5's count-1 arm, MOTIR-3501).
   *
   * §5's asymmetry is unchanged at every other count: adding to the org creates NO
   * workspace membership, because an org-only member in zero workspaces is a valid
   * state (a billing admin) and a plain org member reaches only workspaces they are
   * explicitly added to. That reasoning holds while the workspace tier offers a
   * CHOICE. §6 hides the tier entirely below two workspaces, so at count 1 the old
   * rule placed the invitee into a tier with no UI, no switcher and no
   * add-to-workspace action anywhere on the org roster — an onboarding dead end
   * whose only visible exit (create a workspace) splits the team in two.
   *
   * ⚠️ THE COUNT IS THE ORGANIZATION'S, NOT THE ACTOR'S, and that distinction is
   * the whole card. `workspace`'s RLS used to admit a row only via the caller's own
   * memberships, so this read answered with the ACTOR's slice — 1 where the truth
   * was 2 — and a count-1 predicate built on it would fire in a TWO-workspace org
   * whenever the inviting admin happened to belong to one of them, creating exactly
   * the membership §5 withholds. `workspace_org_member_read` (MOTIR-3512) is what
   * makes the honest count readable here. §6's DISCLOSURE arm reads the opposite
   * predicate — the VIEWER's count — and the two must not be unified; the ADR now
   * says which governs which.
   *
   * ⚠️ AND THE WRITE NEEDS `app.workspace_id` BOUND. `membership_insert_active_or_bootstrap`
   * gates the INSERT on `"workspaceId" = current_setting('app.workspace_id')`, which
   * an org context never binds — without the bind this raises `new row violates
   * row-level security policy for table "workspace_membership"`. This is the exact
   * downward mirror of `workspacesService.addMember`, which binds the ORG guc
   * mid-transaction for the upward auto-join. Same SECURITY constraint as that call:
   * the id comes from a TRUSTED resolution — the org's own workspace row, read
   * inside this transaction — never from request input.
   *
   * The actor must be an org owner/admin. Idempotency: a duplicate
   * (organizationId, userId) raises AlreadyOrgMemberError; a duplicate workspace
   * membership is swallowed, exactly as `ensureOrgMembership` does upward.

   *     here, so the membership branch is the one that bites).
