// Settings → Account → GIT ACCOUNTS (Story MOTIR-4669 · MOTIR-4682).

// Every other card in this story moves something UP a tier. This one moves the
// member's own credential DOWN, to the tier that owns it: `GithubIdentity` is
// `userId @unique` and has never belonged to a workspace.
//
// What this file guards, and why each is here rather than assumed:
//
//   1. THE ABSENCES. No repository list, no installation lifecycle. Those are the
//      organisation's, and a pane here offering "repositories you can see" would
//      re-introduce the tier confusion the whole story removes. An absence only
//      goes red if something asserts it.
//   2. THE DOOR. `/settings/project/code-access`'s connect link, which pointed at
//      a page MOTIR-4680 redirects away.
//   3. THE ROW, and its position — read off the registry's own stated rule.
//   4. THE INK. Danger on a page surface is `--el-danger-on-surface`.
