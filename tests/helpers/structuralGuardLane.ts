//
// It lives here rather than in `vitest.guards.config.ts` because it has THREE
// readers that must never disagree: that config's `include`, the root
// `vitest.config.ts`'s `exclude`, and `tests/ci-structural-guards-lane.test.ts`,
// which re-derives the candidates from the tree and fails if this list has
// drifted from them. (Exporting it from the config itself also made that config
// mix named and default exports, which Rollup warns about on every run.)

/**
 * The lane's membership, exported because it has TWO readers that must never
 * disagree: this config's `include`, and `vitest.config.ts`'s `exclude` — the
 * root run has to drop exactly what this one picks up. A guard listed in one
 * and not the other either runs twice (in the contended job this card exists to
 * leave) or not at all, and both failures are silent.
 *
 * ⚠️ This differs from `vitest.design.config.ts` in the one way that matters.
 * That lane ADDS a run: its specs stay in the root config too, because its
 * purpose is to reach branch prefixes the root job skips. This lane MOVES the
 * run — the whole point is that these files stop executing inside the sharded
 * database job — so the root config excludes every entry below.

  'tests/theme/modalScrollContainer.test.ts',

  // whole-tree guard in the sharded run. It walks all 1 572 files under `tests/`

  // and asserted there.
  'tests/helpers/importGraph.test.ts',

  // Same shape again: a text walk of `app/` + `components/` + the design
  // system's `src/`, plus two stylesheets, asserting that every viewport-sized
  // length on the shell path is written in `dvh`. It opens no database, renders
  // nothing, and imports nothing from `lib/` or `app/`, so it carries no
  // coverage out of the merged report.
  'tests/theme/shellViewportUnits.test.ts',
  // ── tests/theme/ — the named `max-w-*` guard (MOTIR-4084) ─────────────────
  // The same shape as `shellViewportUnits` two entries up, and for a defect of
  // the same family: a Tailwind utility whose name says one thing and whose
  // emitted value says another, because a `@theme` namespace shadows the scale
  // the class is named after. It walks `app/` + `components/` + the design

  // the generated client's payload and input generics are named only under
  // `lib/repositories/**`. It opens no database, renders nothing, and imports

  // happens to be running, which is what this lane is for.
  'tests/prisma/typeBoundary.test.ts',
  // ── tests/packages/ — the package IMPORT-DIRECTION guard (MOTIR-4299) ─────

  // and the reason it moves NOW is that MOTIR-4299 made it bigger: the fly
  // adapter left `lib/` for `packages/orchestrator/src`, so the guard gained a
  // fourth scanned root and reads more of the tree than it did. It walks `lib`,
  // `app`, `components` and the package's `src`, comment-strips every file and
  // tests seven patterns against every line — the same cost profile as the three
  // `tests/theme/` entries above, with no database and no coverage to carry.
  // Found by the census in `tests/typecheck-program/guards-bite.test.ts`, which

  // ⚠️ IT IS HERE BY DERIVATION, NOT BY COST, and that is worth saying because
  // the file itself reads five named files and takes ~10 ms. It imports THIS
  // MODULE — the lane's membership list — and the candidate predicate keys on a
  // spec importing a module whose TEXT carries a filesystem entry point. This
  // file's prose is full of the word `readdirSync`, so anything importing it is
  // a candidate by construction. `tests/ci-structural-guards-lane.test.ts` has
  // the same property and has always been in the lane, which is why nobody had
  // met it. Listing it is cheaper than teaching a text predicate to read
  // comments, and it costs the lane nothing.
  'tests/typecheck-program/guards-bite.test.ts',
  // ── tests/legal/ — the EGRESS-MANIFEST guard (MOTIR-3631 · MOTIR-4008) ────
  // Same shape once more: a text walk of `lib/` + `app/` for outbound hosts,
  // read against `package.json` and `lib/legal/egressManifest.ts`.
  //
  // ⚠️ ITS SUBJECT CHANGED AND ITS PROFILE DID NOT. It used to read the two
  // published pages; those left for `motir-marketing` with the documents
  // (MOTIR-3909), and the EVIDENCE could not follow them — measured there it
  // would pass forever. So the guard holds this tree against the committed
  // manifest this application serves, and `motir-marketing` holds its page
  // against that manifest (`docs/decisions/public-surface-hosts.md`
  // AMENDMENT 2 §E). It still reads ~1 650 files, which is precisely the
  // profile this lane exists to keep out of the sharded database job — and it
  // still opens no database, renders nothing, and imports only a data module
  // from `lib/`, so it carries no meaningful coverage into the merged report.
  'tests/legal/egress-manifest-guard.test.ts',
  // ── tests/legal/ — the content/legal ABSENCE guard (MOTIR-4104) ──────────
  // The same shape as its neighbour above and as `abandonedPath` further up: it
  // walks `app/` + `lib/` + `components/` through `contentLegalReaderGuard.ts`,
  // comment-stripping every file, and asks whether anything still reaches the
  // document source MOTIR-4103 deleted. It also asks git for `content/`'s
  // population, which is a second whole-tree entry point in the same file.
  //
  // It opens no database, renders nothing, and imports only
  // `tests/helpers/importGraph`, so it carries no coverage into the merged
  // report. Its scanner module is not listed here for the same reason
  // `abandonedPathGuard.ts` is not: the lane runs SPECS, and the scanner reaches
  // the tree only through this one.
  'tests/legal/contentLegalReader.test.ts',
  // ── tests/legal/ — the `legal.*` CATALOGUE SPLIT guard (MOTIR-4104) ──────
  // Same profile as the entry above, through `legalCatalogueGuard.ts`: it walks
  // `app/` + `components/` (reusing that guard's tree walker), comment-strips
  // every file and extracts the message keys each namespace binding reads, then
  // sets that population against `messages/en.json`. It opens no database,

  // sibling scanner, so it carries no coverage into the merged report.
  'tests/legal/legalCatalogueSplit.test.ts',
  // ── the 2FA-enforcement guards (Story MOTIR-1215 · MOTIR-3649) ────────────
  // Four at once, and they were DERIVED rather than remembered — which is the
  // whole argument for a mechanical membership predicate. Each walks the tree
  // (`app/`, `app/api/`, `lib/`) through the shared sweeps in
  // `tests/helpers/twoFactorGuardSweeps.ts`, so extracting those sweeps is what
  // made them visible to this list at all: before MOTIR-3649 each guard walked
  // `process.cwd()` inline, and nothing derived it.
  //
  // Their cost profile is the lane's exactly — no database, no render, one
  // whole-tree filesystem answer — and `two-factor-api-gate` is the heaviest of
  // the four, reading every file under `app/api/**` (199 authenticating ones)
  // with comments stripped. `proxy-matcher` also drives `proxy()` itself, which
  // needs `next/server` and nothing else.
  //
  // ⚠️ `twoFactorHasSecondFactor` carries the predicate's EQUIVALENCE tests
  // beside its one-implementation walk. Those are pure input-space maths over

  // ── tests/jobs/ — the vendor-retirement guard (MOTIR-3418) ────────────────
  // Same profile as `abandonedPath` one entry up: it asks a WHOLE-TREE question
  // (does any tracked file still import the retired job runtime, does any shipped
  // path still read one of its environment variables) and answers it with
  // `git ls-files` / `git grep`, which is a REF-based read rather than a walk of

  // report.
  'tests/jobs/inngest-retired.test.ts',

  // It walks `app/(authed)`, `app/(onboarding)` and `app/(planning)` through
  // `topLevelSegments`, recursing into every nested route group and asking each
  // directory whether it serves a page — the same sweep the four 2FA guards use,
  // and the same cost profile. It was found by THIS FILE'S OWN membership test
  // on the pull request that added it, which is the mechanism working: the guard
  // shipped in the sharded run and was named here before it could time out on
  // somebody else's branch.
  //
  // ⚠️ It reads `lib/robotsPolicy.ts` as SOURCE rather than importing it, for

  // would be a guard the plan under test gets to place — on whichever leg the
  // bin-packer picks, or, in the failure it exists to catch, on no leg at all. A
  // check that its own subject can switch off is not a check. It also fits the
  // lane on the ordinary grounds: it asks a whole-tree question (glob every test
  // file, compare against the plan's assignment), opens no database, and imports
  // nothing from `lib/` or `app/`, so it carries no coverage into the merged
  // report.
  'tests/vitest-shard-plan.test.ts',

  // `vitest.config.ts`'s 15 s default. It opens no database and imports only
  // `tests/helpers/timeoutBudget`, which imports nothing at all, so it carries
  // no coverage into the merged report.
  //
  // ⚠️ It is here for the second reason `vitest-shard-plan` is, and the stronger
  // one: it guards a property OF THE SHARDED RUN. Left inside that run it would
  // be a check its own subject can starve — the shape it exists to catch is a
  // shard going 2.4–2.9x over its siblings, which is exactly the condition under

 * ── THE PROPERTY, NOT THE HELPER ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The filesystem ENTRY POINTS a guard can reach the tree through. MOTIR-3144's
 * membership test asked a narrower question — *does this module parse the tree
 * with the TypeScript compiler API?* — and that question is about the
 * IMPLEMENTATION a guard happens to use, not about the property that makes one
 * flake: doing whole-tree filesystem work under a budget sized for a database
 * query, on a contended, coverage-instrumented shard.
 *
 * `tests/coverage-gate-globs.test.ts` is what the difference cost. It globs with

 * So the predicate enumerates the entry points, and each says WHY it is a
