// E2E — the PLANNER SPEAKS in the plan-change thread (Subtask MOTIR-2226,
// consuming MOTIR-2222; design `design/ai-chat/` § "The planner SPEAKS…").
//
// Drives the whole loop from the user's seat: a planning turn comes back with a
// QUESTION, the rail shows it and the composer asks for the answer, the reply is
// sent, and the thread resumes — plus the two things the design says must hold
// beyond the happy path: the pending state SURVIVES A RELOAD (it is derived from
// the persisted thread, not from client state), and a question the user ignores
// is SUPERSEDED rather than dropped or blocking.
//
// DETERMINISM (`notes.html` #37 · `motir-core/CLAUDE.md` § E2E waits on the
// authoritative signal). Every assertion here waits on a real response or a real
// DOM state; there is no `waitForTimeout` anywhere in the file.
//
// WHAT IS STUBBED, and why only this. motir-ai has no presence in CI, so the two
// hops that reach it are faked at the BROWSER boundary — the only interceptable
// seam (a server-side fetch out of a route handler is not reachable from
// `page.route`; mistakes #112 / #152): the SUBMIT, and the planner-turn
// recording, whose real route would call motir-ai's `GET /v1/jobs/:id`.
//
// Everything else is REAL, and deliberately so — the point of the card is that
// the planner's turn is a PERSISTED row rather than client chrome, and a spec
// that faked the thread would prove nothing about that:
//   • the assistant turn is written to Postgres by the stub (through the same
//     locked service append the route would have used), so the rail renders a
//     genuine row;
//   • the thread the rail shows is re-read through the real open/resume endpoint;
//   • the ANSWER is a real `POST …/session/turns` against motir-core + Postgres;
//   • the reload re-reads that thread from the database, which is the whole
//     assertion.
