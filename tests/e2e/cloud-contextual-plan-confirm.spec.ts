// Acceptance E2E — CONTEXTUAL planning from a work item (Subtask MOTIR-913,
// Story MOTIR-812).
//
// Runs under playwright.acceptance.config.ts (video: 'on') so the CI
// acceptance-video lane records a chaptered clip; `acceptanceStory()` pins every
// recording to Story MOTIR-812 regardless of the PR that triggered the run.
//
// The story's whole flow, from the user's seat: you are LOOKING AT a work item,
// you ask for a plan change from that item's own door, you review what came
// back, you confirm, and it lands UNDER that item.
//
//   1. The per-item Plan / Re-plan entrance (MOTIR-910) opens the universal
//      planning workspace ANCHORED at that item — a scoped conversation, not the
//      project-wide one.
//   2. A turn runs, narrates, and settles into REVIEW with the engine's real
//      proposals rendered. Not the `EMPTY` state — that is the regression
//      MOTIR-1746 fixed and this spec's standing guard (every motir-ai plan-edit
//      handler returns `planDelta: { operations: [] }`, so a delta-driven rail
//      could never leave `EMPTY`).
//   3. NOTHING IS WRITTEN until the confirm. This is the gate — the single most
//      important assertion here (Story MOTIR-812 / the MOTIR-911 persist gate).
//   4. Confirm → the items appear under the anchor and the Plan is `approved`.
//   5. The SIBLING-under-the-parent and PARENT-re-plan cases go through the same
//      confirm (test 2 / test 3): what may be PROPOSED is not scope-limited to
//      the anchor's own subtree, but everything WRITTEN still passes one gate.
//   6. Discard declines the Plan and leaves the tree untouched (test 4); a failed
//      run is recoverable in place (test 5).
//
// DETERMINISM (`notes.html` #37 · `motir-core/CLAUDE.md` § E2E waits on the
// authoritative signal). motir-ai has no presence in CI, so the browser→ai hop is
// stubbed via `page.route` — the only interceptable one (a server-side fetch out
// of a route handler is NOT reachable from `page.route`, mistakes #112 / #152).
// Everything on THIS side of that hop runs REAL:
//
//   • the item-anchored THREAD — the submit stub lets the REAL route run first,
//     which appends the user's turn to Postgres before it ever reaches motir-ai
//     (`contextualPlanningService.planFromWorkItem`: `appendTurn` precedes
//     `submit`), then re-reads the thread through the shipped resume GET. So the
//     turns the rail renders are genuinely persisted rows, never stub echoes;
//   • the PROPOSALS — a real `Plan`, seeded through the same
//     `createPlan → addProposals → markPlanned` calls the handler's own callbacks
//     make (MOTIR-1746), so the review is `planReviewService` reading Postgres;
//   • the review READ, the approve and the decline — `/api/plans/[id]`,
//     `…/approve` (→ `plansService.approvePlan` → `materialize`, behind the
//     MOTIR-911 gate) and `…/decline`, so every assertion lands on real DB state;
//   • the canvas levels — the shipped per-level roadmap endpoint.
//
// Only the job DISPATCH and the job's SSE are stubbed. The streaming state is
// observed by HOLDING the plan read until the assertion has run — an
// authoritative gate, never a timeout.

/**
 * Stub the item-anchored SUBMIT — `POST /api/work-items/[id]/ai/plan`, the one
 * hop of a contextual turn that reaches motir-ai. The anchored contract FUSES
 * appending the turn and submitting it (MOTIR-909 gates the anchor set once), so
 * a stub that simply answered would mean the user's turn was never persisted and
 * the rail would render a thread the app never wrote.
 *
 * So this does not fake the thread: it FIRES the real route, which appends the
 * turn to Postgres before it ever reaches motir-ai, and then re-reads the
 * resulting thread through the shipped resume `GET`. The stub contributes exactly
 * the two facts motir-ai would have: the `jobId` and — the shipped MOTIR-1745
 * contract — the `planId` of the Plan the run's proposals live in, which is what
 * the rail reads and confirms. A stub answering with only a `jobId` would leave
 * the rail with nothing to confirm, which is the shape of the bug MOTIR-1746
 * fixed.
 *
 * ⚠️ It does NOT await that real call. The append commits early; the request then
 * spends seconds failing to reach a motir-ai that CI does not run (an unresolvable
 * host), and waiting for that would put a multi-second stall inside every turn —
 * latency a loaded runner could stretch past the response timeout, for no signal.
 * So the append is observed DIRECTLY instead: poll the resume until the turn is
 * actually on the thread (`waitForAppendedTurn`). That is the authoritative
 * signal — the committed row — rather than the failure's arrival time.
 *
 * A RESUBMIT (the rail's Try again) rides the same route and deliberately appends
 * NOTHING, so the expected turn count does not move and the read settles at once.
