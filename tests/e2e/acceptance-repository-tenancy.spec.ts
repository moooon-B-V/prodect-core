// A REPOSITORY BELONGS TO THE ORGANISATION — THE ACCEPTANCE RECEIPT
// (Story MOTIR-4669 · Subtask MOTIR-4685). The story's verification recipe,
// performed in a browser.
//
// ── WHAT A REVIEWER IS WATCHING FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One number: the second project pays NOTHING. Before this story a repository
// was connected to a WORKSPACE, so the same repository in two workspaces of one
// organisation was two connections and two code graphs built from identical
// bytes — and a user who wanted their code in a second project was asked to go
// and connect it again, with no way to tell that Motir already had it.
//
// So the clip's centre of gravity is chapter 2: the SAME repository appears in a
// project in a DIFFERENT WORKSPACE, reading `already indexed · shared`, and the
// index ledger does not grow. Chapters 3–5 then show the tier doing its other
// job — one inventory that knows who uses what, and two removals that share a
// word and not a blast radius.
//
// ── ⚠️ WHY THIS LANE, DECIDED BEFORE A LINE WAS WRITTEN (the card's own AC) ──
//
// `docs/acceptance-lane-triage.md`: the acceptance lane's server is CLOUD-ON with
// `E2E_TEST_GITHUB_REPOS`, `MOTIR_AI_URL` and `E2E_TEST_CODE_HEALTH`; the main
// lane is NONE of those. This walk needs a git host to exist at all, so the main
// lane would not fail it — it would pass it, off a short-circuited path, which is
// the MOTIR-2601 trap that document exists to name. It stays in the acceptance
// lane.
//
// ── ⚠️ HOW THE CONNECT BEAT REACHES GITHUB, AND WHAT THAT COSTS ─────────────
//
// NAMED rather than glossed. The App install round trip runs on GITHUB'S OWN
// SERVERS — a user picks repositories on github.com and is redirected back — so
// no browser step can perform it. Chapter 1 therefore performs the connect by
// calling `seedGithubInstallation`, which is
// `githubInstallationService.persistInstallation`: the EXACT function the
// post-install redirect (MOTIR-1588) and the webhook grant-mirror both call, and
// the one that enqueues the first index. Everything the clip then shows is the
// shipped product reading real rows.
//
// What is NOT faked anywhere: the picker, both settings pages, every read, both
// removals, the org-admin gate, and the index ledger the "nothing re-indexes"
// claim is measured against.
//
// ── PACING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Five chapters, each a thing a person can watch happen. Nothing navigates that
// does not show something new, and the two beats worth pausing on — the
// one-segment picker in chapter 1 and `already indexed · shared` in chapter 2 —
// are the story's thesis and its payoff, in that order.

  //
  // Set on the ORG ROW, not through the billing fixture. `pmTierForOrg` reads
  // `isMeta` / `scaledTrackerSubscription` / `aiIncludedSeat` off the row via
  // `findCapContextInTx`; the motir-ai fixture answers a DIFFERENT question
