// ⚠️ RE-POINTED FOR THE OVERLAY (MOTIR-4732, story MOTIR-4725). The planning
// workspace was a ROUTE at `/planning`; it is a full-screen OVERLAY on the page
// you are already on. So an address that used to BE the workspace is now a host
// page plus four namespaced parameters, and a `waitForURL` that matched the old
// path matches nothing. The assertions about what the workspace DOES are
// unchanged — only how it is reached and how its arrival is detected.
//
// (`/planning?…` still resolves: `app/(authed)/planning/page.tsx` forwards an old
// link to the host page it belonged to. Its own coverage is in
// `tests/integration/planning/planChangeSeams.test.ts`; these specs address the
// overlay directly, which is what a reader would write today.)

// ACCEPTANCE — ask about this project, then act on it, in ONE conversation
// (Story MOTIR-1343 · Subtask MOTIR-1823).
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THE CLIP HAS TO SHOW, and why step 6 is the whole point. Every other
// step here proves a feature works. Step 6 proves the SHAPE of the product: the
// callout's rows share one surface *because a person changes topic mid-sentence*,
// so a thread that could answer but not act would be the failure the design was
// built to prevent. A viewer has to watch somebody ask a question, get a cited
// answer, and then — with no control touched, no mode chosen, nothing closed —
// ask for a change and see the confirm chrome arrive. That absence of a gesture
// is the deliverable, which is exactly why it has to be filmed rather than
// asserted in a unit test.
//
// ── THE BOUNDARY, and why it is not a `page.route` ──────────────────────────
// The ask journey crosses motir-core → motir-ai three times and only the STREAM
// is a browser-visible relay; the submit and the settle happen inside the Next
// server. Stubbing the two core routes at the browser would mean faking the
// answer — and an answer the browser faked was never written, which is precisely
// what step 4's reload has to prove. So the seam is `lib/test-ai-jobs-mock.ts`,
// an undici intercept under the routes (`E2E_TEST_AI_JOBS=1`), and the real
// route → service → repository → Postgres chain runs for all seven steps.
//
// ── THE LANE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The ACCEPTANCE lane, and the reason is the environment as much as the receipt:
// the workspace only mounts with `MOTIR_AI_URL` set, and the jobs mock this spec
// declares its fixtures to is installed by that lane's config.
