/**
 * The operator ORG LOOKUP and ORG PAGE — MOTIR-4566, design
 * `platform-admin/design-notes.md` Panels 10 and 11.
 *
 * ⚠️ A SMOKE SPEC IN THE BUILDING CARD'S OWN PULL REQUEST, deliberately, rather
 * than deferred to the story's E2E card. This is the FIRST card in Story
 * MOTIR-4337 that renders a page, and a server/client-seam defect on a route
 * nobody opens survives every later card's green build — the later card would
 * find it, but only after four more cards had been written on top of it.
 *
 * Two assertions, and the second is the one that cannot be checked any other
 * way: the surface RENDERS for platform staff, and it is a 404 — not a 403, not
 * a redirect — for everybody else. The layout gate's own unit suite
 * (`tests/platform/adminRouteGate.test.ts`) proves the layout CALLS
 * `notFound()`; only a browser proves the response a non-staff person actually
 * receives.
