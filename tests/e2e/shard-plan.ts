// The bulk-leg shard plan (MOTIR-2617) — spec→leg membership derived from
// MEASURED per-spec cost, not from Playwright's `--shard=i/5` slice.
//
// WHY this exists. `--shard=i/N` partitions by test COUNT, keeping whole files
// together in DISCOVERY (alphabetical) order and slicing contiguously. Nothing
// about that slice knows what a spec costs, so the heaviest specs collect on
// whichever leg the alphabet drops them on, and nothing notices when a new spec
// joins the pile. Measured over two green `main` runs (below), the count-based
// split ran the five bulk legs at 159–280 s of test time — a 55 %-of-mean spread
// with the slowest leg carrying ~1.75× the fastest. That imbalance is the
// standing input to the `bulk-4` webServer-degradation flake (MOTIR-2617, three
// occurrences: PRs #1636 / #1912 / #2014): one runner accumulates the load, its
// `next start` server creeps over a memory/CPU cliff partway through the shard,
// and every navigation after that point hangs for the full 180 s test timeout.
//
// So membership is computed here instead: `SPEC_COST_SECONDS` records what each
// spec actually cost, and `assignBulkLegs` bin-packs those costs across the legs
// (longest-processing-time first — the standard greedy makespan heuristic,
// deterministic and total). On the same measurement the spread drops to <1 %.
//
// THE GUARD IS THE POINT. `tests/e2e-shard-plan.test.ts` asserts that every spec
// file the main Playwright config can run has a cost entry here. A new spec that
// nobody measured therefore fails the unit lane instead of silently landing on
// whichever leg the alphabet picks — which is exactly the failure mode above.
//
// Consumed by `playwright.config.ts` (E2E_SHARD=<leg id> → `testMatch`) and by
// the `e2e` matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Deliberately dependency-free:
// the Playwright config imports it at module scope, and so does a vitest guard.

/**
 * MEASURED per-spec cost, in seconds of test execution.
 *
 * Source: the `e2e-harness/*.jsonl` series of the five `playwright-report-bulk-*`
 * artifacts of run **33251966134** (2026-08-29, PR #2453, green), summing every
 * `test` record's `durationMs` per spec file. Playwright attributes hook time to
 * the test it runs for, so this includes each spec's seeding, not just its
 * assertions. One run, not an average of two — said plainly rather than dressed
 * up as the older method below.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE NUMBERS THIS REPLACED WERE FROM 2026-08-10 AND HAD DRIFTED FAR ENOUGH TO
 * MATTER (MOTIR-3913). The guard checks these costs against THEMSELVES — it
 * asserts the legs balance to within 15% of what this table says — so it stayed
 * green for nineteen days while reality moved. Net of each leg's pre-test boot,
 * the five legs actually ran 269 / 321 / 381 / 315 / 337 s: a 1.42x spread, not
 * the 1.007x the old table predicted. The two worst entries had moved by more
 * than a factor of two in OPPOSITE directions — `jobs-flow.spec.ts` 89.7 → 25.7 s
 * and `code-graph-refresh-engine.spec.ts` 26.0 → 56.6 s — which is why the drift
 * did not simply cancel. The lesson for whoever reads this next: a green guard is
 * not evidence this table is current, and only a run can tell you.
 *
 * `app-role-surfaces.spec.ts` moved 0 → 1.3 s, which is a category change rather
 * than drift: it now contributes tests to a bulk leg where it previously
 * contributed none. See the `0` paragraph below for why that distinction matters.
 *
 * A `0` is a real measurement, not a gap: those specs contribute NO tests to a
 * bulk leg because every test in them is selected away by the legs'
 * `--grep-invert "(board(-scrum)?|collab|epic6)-at-scale|@a11y"` — they belong to
 * the at-scale or @a11y legs. They are still assigned a bulk leg (Playwright
 * loads the file and finds nothing to run) so that "every spec file belongs to
 * exactly one leg" stays a total statement the guard can check.
 *
 * TO RE-MEASURE: download the `playwright-report-bulk-*` artifacts of a green
 * run and read the `e2e-harness/*.jsonl` series inside them — the harness
 * watchdog's `test` records carry a per-spec `durationMs` alongside the memory
 * samples, and summing those is what produced the numbers above. (The HTML
 * report in the same artifact shards its data across content-hashed files and is
 * the harder path to the same figures.) Re-measure whenever a leg's OBSERVED
 * test time drifts from what this table predicts — that comparison, not the
 * guard, is the thing that can tell you these numbers have aged.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE TWELVE SPECS PROMOTED BY MOTIR-2769 carry a DIFFERENT provenance, stated
 * so nobody averages them with the rest: they were measured LOCALLY, in one run
 * against a production build on 2026-08-13, because they had never run in this
 * lane before and a spec with no entry is assigned to no leg at all. They are
 * honest numbers for one machine, not the two-CI-run average above — expect CI
 * to differ, and re-measure them from the first green run that includes them.
 * `onboarding-migrate.spec.ts` (43.5 s) is by far the heaviest of the twelve and
 * is the one to watch when the bin-packer redistributes.
 *
 * ⚠️ `modal-scroll-container.spec.ts` (MOTIR-2491) carries the LOCAL provenance
 * too — a brand-new spec, three tests, each a sign-up + first project (one of
 * them a seeded sprint tree) and one short-viewport dialog. Measured on
 * 2026-09-05 against a production build on its own port and database, JSON
 * reporter, per-test `durationMs` summed: **5.6 s** (2.0 + 2.0 + 1.6) on a warm
 * server; the same three ran in 38–39 s of wall clock including harness
 * startup. Recorded as 6.0 — rounded UP, because under-estimating is the
 * direction that unbalances a bin-packer. Re-measure from the first green CI
 * run that includes it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `plan-decision-permission.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3188) carries the LOCAL provenance
 * too, for the same reason the twelve above do: it is a brand-new spec, and a
 * spec with no entry here is assigned to no leg and never runs — which is what
 * the guard caught on its first CI run. Measured on 2026-08-20 against a
 * production build, twice: **2.8 s** alone on a cold server and **1.8 s** in a
 * warm run beside two siblings. The HIGHER reading is recorded, because
 * under-estimating is the direction that unbalances a bin-packer.
 *
 * That same run is the CALIBRATION for every local number in this file, which
 * nothing had until now: `custom-roles.spec.ts` measured **8.3 s** locally
 * against **8.2 s** here, and `roles-permissions.spec.ts` **6.5 s** against
 * **9.3 s**. So a local reading is in the same units and runs at or below the CI
 * cost — never above it. Re-measure from the first green run that includes it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `plan-proposal-correction.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3543) carries the LOCAL provenance
 * too, and the guard caught it with no entry on its FIRST CI run — the failure
 * this file exists to make loud, working exactly as designed: the spec passed
 * locally and would have been assigned to no leg and never run.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-26 against a production build, on its own port and
 * database, THREE times: **14.7 s** on a cold server, then **7.4 s** and
 * **6.3 s** warm. The COLD reading is what is recorded, following
 * `plan-decision-permission.spec.ts` above — under-estimating is the direction
 * that unbalances a bin-packer, and this spec's first navigation compiles the
 * plan-detail route. The spread is wider than the others here because the spec
 * drives six MCP round trips interleaved with four page loads, so a warm run
 * saves proportionally more. Re-measure from the first green CI run that
 * includes it; expect something between the two.
 *
 * ⚠️ `cloud-follow-the-build-flow.spec.ts` (MOTIR-1117; MOVED to the cloud lane
 *    by MOTIR-4038, so it no longer carries a cost here) carries the LOCAL provenance
 * too, measured TWICE rather than the usual three times — said plainly rather
 * than dressed up as the usual method.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-27 against a production build, on its own port (3411) and
 * its own database, each on a COLD server: **3.3 s** and **3.4 s**, both
 * `1 passed (2.2m)` including harness startup. The two agree to within 0.1 s,
 * which is a tighter spread than any other local entry here — this spec has no
 * warm/cold gap to speak of because a production build compiles no route on
 * first hit, so the third reading the others needed to separate cold from warm
 * has nothing left to tell.
 *
 * Two EARLIER runs are not readings: both failed on defects in the spec itself
 * (an illegal `todo → done` seed transition, then an assertion that raced the
 * followed button's hover label), so their 1.3 s and 33.5 s measure a crash and
 * a 30-second locator timeout rather than the journey.
 *
 * 3.3 s is the FASTEST entry in this table, which is plausible for what it does
 * — two sign-ups and six navigations, no drag, no chart, no at-scale seed — but
 * it was measured on a box running several parallel sessions at load ~4, so the
 * readings are if anything pessimistic rather than flattering.
 *
 * **Re-measure from the first green CI run that includes it**, and expect a
 * higher number: the local readings above run at or below their CI cost, never
 * above it, and under-estimating is the direction that unbalances a bin-packer.
 *
 * ⚠️ `two-factor.spec.ts` (MOTIR-1223) carries the LOCAL provenance too, and the
 * guard caught it with no entry before it ever reached CI — which is this file
 * working as designed: the spec passed locally and would have been assigned to no
 * leg and never run.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-26 against a production build, on its own port (3217) and
 * its own database, THREE times: **13.3 s** on a cold server, then **12.6 s** and
 * **10.4 s** warm. The COLD reading is recorded, following the two entries above
 * — under-estimating is the direction that unbalances a bin-packer. The spread is
 * narrow because the spec's cost is dominated by six full sign-in journeys rather
 * than by first-hit route compilation; what a warm run saves is the enrol page's
 * initial compile, paid once.
 *
 * It is the heaviest new entry since `onboarding-migrate.spec.ts` and worth
 * watching when the bin-packer redistributes: six tests, each of which signs up,
 * enrols with a real RFC-6238 code, and signs in again.
 *
 * ⚠️ `jobs-fanout-engine.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3462) carries the LOCAL provenance too,
 * and for the reason the guard exists: a brand-new spec with no entry here is
 * assigned to no leg and never runs — which is exactly what the guard caught on
 * its first CI run. Measured on 2026-08-26 against a production build, on its
 * own lane with its own port and database: **4.7 s + 1.8 s + 1.8 s = 8.3 s** of
 * test time (the ~4.7 min wall is the build, which the legs pay once). Like the
 * others here, it is an honest number for one machine and one run — re-measure
 * it from the first green CI run that includes it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `jobs-postgres-engine.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3427) carries the LOCAL provenance
 * too, and it is a brand-new spec — the guard caught it with no entry on its
 * first CI run, which is exactly the failure this file exists to make loud: a
 * spec with no cost here is assigned to NO leg and never runs, so it would have
 * gone green by not executing.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-25 against a production build, TWICE, six tests each:
 * 18.2 s and 18.0 s of test bodies. Recorded as **22.0**, from the sum of the
 * per-test MAXIMA across the two runs (20.3 s) plus headroom — the higher
 * reading is the one to keep, because under-estimating is the direction that
 * unbalances a bin-packer, and the calibration note above says a local reading
 * runs at or below the CI cost.
 *
 * ⚠️ `project-repositories-api.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3591) carries the LOCAL
 * provenance too, and the guard caught it with no entry on its FIRST CI run —
 * the failure this file exists to make loud, working exactly as designed. It is
 * worth saying what that cost, because it is the sharpest instance yet: the spec
 * had been run locally and was green, the five bulk legs were green, and the
 * spec had run in NEITHER of them. A green bulk leg is not evidence that a new
 * spec ran.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-26 against a production build, on its own port and
 * database, twice: **3.2 s** on a cold server (1.7 + 0.9 + 0.5) and **1.8 s**
 * warm. The COLD reading is recorded, following the specs above — the first
 * request compiles the `/api/v1/projects/[projectKey]/repositories` route, and
 * under-estimating is the direction that unbalances a bin-packer. It is cheap
 * because it drives no browser: three bearer-authenticated HTTP reads and their
 * seeding, with no page load at all. Re-measure from the first green CI run that
 * includes it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `jobs-scheduled-engine.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3473) is the same story, one card
 * later — brand new, and the guard caught it with no entry on its first CI run.
 * Same LOCAL provenance, measured on 2026-08-25 against a production build.
 *
 * ⚠️ ITS 85.0 WAS A CEILING BOUGHT BY ONE SCENARIO, AND MOTIR-3314 REMOVED THAT
 * SCENARIO — so the entry is now **25.0**. The reasoning is kept rather than
 * replaced, because the ceiling argument is still right and only its input
 * changed.
 *
 * What made the old number a ceiling: the catch-up scenario waited for a REAL
 * `* * * * *` fire to pass on the scheduler's own watch — the only way to
 * observe the `skip` disposition through this lane — and that wait was uniformly
 * 0–60 s depending on where in the minute the spec started. Two back-to-back
 * runs against the same server MEASURED the swing directly: that scenario took
 * **10.1 s** in one and **51.0 s** in the next, 41 s from nothing but the wall
 * clock. Totals were 23.3 s and 61.8 s of test bodies.
 *
 * Clustering the crons left no per-minute job for it to wait on, so the scenario
 * was removed and its coverage moved to `tests/jobs/engine-scheduler.test.ts`
 * (see the removal note in the spec). **Subtracting it from the two measured
 * runs leaves 13.2 s and 10.8 s of test bodies** — the wall-clock swing was
 * entirely that scenario's, which is why the remainder is nearly a point value.
 * 25.0 keeps this file's own bias: round UP, because under-estimating is the
 * direction that unbalances a bin-packer, and a leg packed against the ceiling
 * is merely early.
 *
 * **This is DERIVED from the two recorded runs, not re-measured.** Re-measure
 * from the first green CI run that includes the change.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NO LONGER RUNS A THIRD PROCESS. This spec used to start the Postgres job
 * engine's worker (`tests/e2e/_helpers/job-worker-process.ts`) for the scenario
 * above; nothing in it does now. That startup was paid ONCE in `globalSetup` and
 * never appeared in this per-spec cost either way.
 *
 * ⚠️ `shell-viewport-floor.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3208, re-measured for MOTIR-3286)
 * carries a FOURTH provenance: it had never run in this lane, so it was measured
 * LOCALLY against a production build on 2026-08-20 — three test BODIES at
 * 2.6 / 1.2 / 1.1 s (4.9 s total, sign-up and seeding included, since this spec
 * seeds inside the test rather than in a hook), rounded to 8.0 to cover the
 * three `resetDatabase()` hooks the reporter attributes separately.
 *
 * MOTIR-3286 added a FOURTH test (the containing-block leak) and re-measured the
 * same way on 2026-08-21: bodies at 2.3 / 1.1 / 0.7 / 0.7 s = **4.8 s**. The
 * bodies did not grow — the new test is one of the cheap ones and the run was
 * warmer — but there is now a fourth hook, and the 8.0 entry priced hooks at
 * (8.0 − 4.9) / 3 ≈ 1.03 s each. 4.8 + 4 × 1.03 ≈ 8.9, recorded as **9.5**:
 * rounding UP is the safe direction, because under-estimating is what unbalances
 * a bin-packer. Re-measure it from the first green CI run that includes it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `app-role-surfaces.spec.ts` (MOTIR-2816) carries a THIRD provenance and a
 * cost of ~0 that is honest for THIS lane and misleading anywhere else. Every
 * test in it calls `test.skip()` unless `E2E_APP_ROLE=1`, and the bulk legs never
 * set that — so in this lane it loads, skips seven tests and contributes no
 * execution time. Under its own harness it is a full sign-in-plus-seven-surfaces
 * pass (measured locally at ~95 s). Re-measure it here only if the flag ever
 * becomes the lane default; until then a real number would be a lie about what
 * the bin-packer is scheduling.
 *
 * ⚠️ `auth-signed-in-bounce.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3372) carries the LOCAL provenance
 * too, and it is here because the guard caught it: a spec with no entry is
 * assigned to no leg, so its first CI run executed it ZERO times while every
 * check went green about it. Measured on 2026-08-21 against a production build
 * on a private cluster, twice: **3.6 s** wall for the file on the first run, and
 * **1.51 s** of test BODIES (1.155 + 0.351) on a warm second run. The gap is the
 * two `resetDatabase()` hooks the reporter attributes separately — ≈1.05 s each,
 * which agrees with the ≈1.03 s/hook figure `shell-viewport-floor` derived above.
 * Recorded as **4.5**: the higher reading, rounded UP, because under-estimating
 * is the direction that unbalances the bin-packer and a local number runs at or
 * below the CI cost. Re-measure from the first green run that includes it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `cascade-under-load.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3767) carries the LOCAL provenance too,
 * and it is the guard's fifth catch — brand new, so with no entry here it would
 * have been assigned to no leg and gone green by never executing.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-28 against a production build, on a private lane with its
 * own port, its own database and its own job worker. Body: **2.5 s**; wall-clock
 * over the file **2.0 m including the production build**. Recorded as **5.0** — the body plus the hooks the
 * reporter attributes separately, rounded UP, for this file's standing reason:
 * under-estimating is the direction that unbalances the bin-packer, and a local
 * number runs at or below the CI cost.
 *
 * ⚠️ `supervision-pool-under-load.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3832) carries the same
 * provenance, and it is the guard's sixth catch — brand new, so with no entry
 * here it would have been assigned to no leg and gone green by never executing.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-28 against a production build, on a private lane with its
 * own port, its own database and its own job worker — FOUR consecutive green
 * runs. Bodies: **4.6 s** and **5.8 s**; wall-clock over the file 21–29 s
 * including `globalSetup`'s worker start. Recorded as **11.0** — the higher body
 * plus the hooks the reporter attributes separately, rounded UP, for this file's
 * standing reason.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT COSTS MORE THAN ITS SIBLING BECAUSE IT FILLS THE POOL. `cascade-under-load`
 * needs ONE long run beside the fast lane; this one needs `POOL_SIZE` of them,
 * because after MOTIR-3762 a single supervisor detains only its own slot and a
 * one-probe spec would pass on the pre-change worker. Ten probes each cycling on
 * a 250 ms defer is what makes the assertion discriminate, and it is where the
 * extra seconds go.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE NUMBER IS ONLY THIS SMALL BECAUSE THE LONG JOB ENDS ON A SIGNAL.
 * The spec needs a run that is still in flight when the cascade lands, and the
 * obvious shape — a job that sleeps for a fixed duration — would have to outlast
 * the cascade's own latency on the SLOWEST runner, so it would cost that
 * worst-case every time it ran. `lib/test-slow-job.ts` waits for a release row
 * the spec writes after asserting instead, so the run costs what the assertions
 * cost and the ordering is pinned rather than raced. Its 30 s clamp is a runaway
 * guard for a spec that dies mid-assertion, never the expected duration.
 *
 * ⚠️ `code-graph-refresh-engine.spec.ts` and `code-graph-writer-seam.spec.ts`
 * (MOTIR-3417) carry the LOCAL provenance too, and they are the guard's fourth
 * catch: both are brand new, so on their first CI run they had no entry here,
 * were assigned to no leg, and would have gone green by never executing.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-26 against a production build, on a private lane with its
 * own port, its own database and its own job worker, TWICE. Bodies:
 * **5.2 / 5.1 / 4.9 / 4.9 s** and **5.3 / 4.5 / 5.2 / 4.8 s** for the four
 * refresh-engine tests, and **4.7 s** then **4.4 s** for the writer seam. The
 * sums of per-test MAXIMA are 20.5 s and 4.7 s; wall-clock over the pair was
 * 28.3 s and 26.7 s, so the hooks the reporter attributes separately cost
 * ≈0.7 s per test here. Recorded as **26.0** and **6.5** — maxima plus hooks,
 * rounded UP, for this file's standing reason: under-estimating is the direction
 * that unbalances a bin-packer.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THESE TWO NUMBERS ARE ONLY HONEST BECAUSE THE SPECS STOPPED SLEEPING.
 * `system.code-graph-refresh` declares `debounce: { period: '2m' }`, and a
 * SIGKILLed worker holds its claim for `LEASE_MS` (60 s). Written the obvious
 * way — waiting both out — the same five tests measured **522 s** and **132 s**,
 * i.e. one spec alone would have exceeded the whole 160–280 s budget of the leg
 * it landed on and recreated the `bulk-4` imbalance this plan exists to remove.
 * Nothing was weakened to get here: each spec ASSERTS the window where it is a
 * claim (`run_at` really is `period` past the last arrival, and nothing has run
 * while it is open) and then expresses it as STATE where it is only a delay, by
 * moving `run_at` into the past. The two durations are asserted BY VALUE, in
 * `tests/jobs/supervisor-cutover-story-gate.test.ts`.
 *
 * So a long declared wait is not a reason to record a large cost here — it is a
 * reason to check whether the spec is asserting the wait or merely serving it.
 * Re-measure both from the first green CI run that includes them.
 *
 * ⚠️ `passkeys.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3615) carries the LOCAL provenance too, and the
 * guard would have caught it with no entry before it reached CI — the spec
 * passed locally and would have been assigned to no leg and never run.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-26 against a production build, on its own port (3177) and
 * its own database, THREE times: **3.8 s**, **4.2 s** and **4.7 s** of TEST time
 * (2.2/2.4/2.9 s for the journey, then ~0.9 s apiece for the two refusals). The
 * HIGHEST is recorded, following the entries above — under-estimating is the
 * direction that unbalances a bin-packer.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE WALL CLOCK IS NOT THE COST. Each of those runs took ~2 minutes end
 * to end, essentially all of it the `webServer`'s own `next build` — a fixed
 * cost every lane pays once, not this spec's. Reading the wall clock would have
 * recorded ~115 s here, roughly nine times the heaviest real entry, and the
 * bin-packer would have built a leg around a number that does not exist. Take
 * the per-test durations the `list` reporter prints, never the summary line.
 *
 * It is cheap for what it does because the ceremonies are virtual: a CDP
 * authenticator answers instantly, where the 2FA spec pays for six real sign-in
 * journeys.
 *
 * ⚠️ `data-subject-request-journey.spec.ts` (MOTIR-3706) carries the LOCAL
 * provenance too, and the entry arrives WITH the spec rather than after a red
 * CI run — which is what the guard above would otherwise have caught: a spec
 * with no cost here is assigned to NO leg and never runs.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-28 against a production build, on its own port (3406) and
 * its own scratch database, TWICE — three tests each, both `3 passed`. Only the
 * SECOND run is a per-test reading (the first was taken with the `line`
 * reporter, which prints the summary and nothing else), so what the first
 * contributes is the pass and not a number. Said plainly rather than averaged
 * in. The readings: **2.8 s + 0.9 s + 0.8 s = 4.5 s** of test bodies.
 *
 * Recorded as **6.0**, the measurement plus headroom, following
 * `jobs-postgres-engine.spec.ts` above — under-estimating is the direction that
 * unbalances a bin-packer, and the calibration note says a local reading runs at
 * or below its CI cost.
 *
 * The deletion journey is the heavy one of the three and its cost is where you
 * would expect: it pays for a sign-UP and then a sign-IN, because the flow it
 * walks deliberately signs the reader out halfway through. The other two are a
 * single navigation each. Re-measure from the first green CI run that includes
 * it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `legal-gone-selfhost.spec.ts` (MOTIR-4105) is new, with the same LOCAL
 * provenance as the three above. Measured on 2026-09-03 against a production
 * build on port 3000, FOUR consecutive runs, `1 passed` every time: **1.5 s,
 * 1.1 s, 0.9 s, 1.1 s** of test body. The four are a deliberate no-flake check
 * the card asked for, not a search for a best case — so the number recorded is
 * the **COLDEST** (1.5 s), following every spec above, because under-estimating
 * is the direction that unbalances a bin-packer.
 *
 * Recorded as **3.0**: the cold reading plus headroom, and in line with its
 * nearest neighbour by shape — `billing-selfhost.spec.ts` at 2.7, which is the
 * same kind of spec (the self-host arm of a capability, driven in the main lane
 * because `playwright.config.ts` IS that arm). It is cheap because five of its
 * assertions are bare HTTP reads with no page load; what it pays for is the one
 * sign-up. Re-measure from the first green CI run that includes it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `hero-ai-control-styles.spec.ts` (MOTIR-4743) carries the LOCAL provenance
 * too, and the guard caught it with no entry on its FIRST CI run — the failure
 * this file exists to make loud, working exactly as designed. Worth stating
 * plainly, because of what the spec IS: it is the only evidence for two of its
 * card's acceptance criteria (every registered style's hero treatment, measured
 * in a browser against the base style). It passed locally, forty-seven other
 * checks went green, and it would have been assigned to no leg and never run.
 * A green bulk leg is not evidence that a new spec ran.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-06 against a production build, on its own port (3743) and
 * its own database, THREE times: **5.3 s** on a cold server, then **7.5 s** and
 * **7.9 s** warm. Recorded as **8.0** — the highest reading, rounded up.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE COLD READING IS THE LOWEST ONE HERE, WHICH INVERTS THE PATTERN EVERY

 * compiles a route; against a production build it compiles nothing, which
 * `cloud-follow-the-build-flow.spec.ts` already observed ("this spec has no
 * warm/cold gap to speak of"). So there is no cold penalty to pay here, and the
 * 5.3 → 7.9 spread is BOX LOAD, not warmth: the readings were taken on a machine
 * running several parallel sessions at load average 5.0. Follow the file's rule
 * rather than its examples — record the HIGHEST reading, because
 * under-estimating is the direction that unbalances a bin-packer.
 *
 * It is cheap for a spec that drives eleven style switches twice over because it
 * runs on `/tokens`, which is public: no sign-up, no seeding, no
 * `resetDatabase()` hook. The four test bodies are 0.6 / 1.7 / 1.5 / 1.5 s and
 * the ~100 s wall clock is the build, which the legs pay once. Re-measure from
