// ⚠️ THE ACCEPTANCE WALK FOR CUSTOMER-OWNED ADDRESSES (Story MOTIR-3878 ·
// Subtask MOTIR-4225) — the APPLICATION half of the verification recipe, paced
// for a person to watch. The public half (a visitor arriving on the new host) is
// `motir-marketing`'s own walk; this one asserts what the customer is SHOWN
// while they set the address up.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE TWO SEAMS, AND WHY A SPEC WITHOUT THEM WOULD BE GREEN FOR EVER ──
//
// The flow crosses two systems that leave this machine: the certificate platform
// and public DNS. `plan-rules/type-test.md`'s tell (d) is exactly this shape — a
// lane that cannot reach the asserted state passes permanently without asserting
// it. `lib/publicAddresses/providers.ts` binds in-memory versions of both, and
// `playwright.acceptance.config.ts` arms them on the webServer.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE ARMING NEEDED A FIX THIS CARD FOUND. That factory refused the fakes
// whenever `NODE_ENV === 'production'` — which this lane is, because it serves a
// `next build`. The flag was therefore INERT in the only lane that needs it. It
// now also asks `isE2EProdHarness()`, the seam this repository already uses for
// that collision, so arming them in a real deployment takes two deliberate
// misconfigurations rather than one. Both arms are asserted in
// `tests/publicAddresses/dnsResolverPort.test.ts`.
//
// The mounting is SELF-DETECTING here rather than merely argued: chapter 1's
// first assertion is that the claim field is present, which the pane renders
// only when a base domain is configured — so a lane that set neither variable
// fails loudly instead of filming an operator error message.
//
// ── ⚠️ TWO OF THE CARD'S ASSERTIONS ARE NOT HERE, AND BOTH ARE RECORDED ────
//
//  1. *"the TXT and CNAME records render"* (step 3). The pane renders the
//     ownership TXT and nothing else: `PublicAddressDto.dns` is built from the
//     verification token alone, and the pointing record the Fly adapter parses
//     is dropped at the mapper. Filed as MOTIR-4278. Asserting a CNAME here
//     would be asserting a screen that does not exist.
//  2. *"on a `free`-tier fixture org, Add a domain is disabled with the upgrade
//     prompt"* (step 6). MOTIR-4229 deliberately does not pre-disable it:
//     `entitlementsService.assertCanAddCustomDomain` records that `free: 0`
//     exists to make the REFUSAL the prompt's trigger "instead of an empty state
//     the pane special-cases". The prompt is covered from the refusal in
//     `tests/settings/customDomainsSection.test.tsx`.
//
// Steps 6 and 7's other arms — the read-only pane, the empty list, the error
// state — are asserted from fixtures in that same suite, where every branch is
// reachable. Re-walking them in a browser would cost a lane minute per arm and
// assert the same render.
