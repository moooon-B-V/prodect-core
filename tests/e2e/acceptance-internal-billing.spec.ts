// AN INTERNAL ORG BILLS LIKE A CUSTOMER — THE ACCEPTANCE RECEIPT
// (Story MOTIR-4337 · Subtask MOTIR-4575). The story's `verification_recipe`,
// performed in a browser.
//
// ── WHAT A REVIEWER IS WATCHING FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This story's deliverable is not a mechanism, it is a VIEW: the ability to sit
// in Motir's own organization and see the billing experience a customer gets.
// That makes this clip unusually literal — the receipt and the feature are the
// same footage. Two of its seconds carry most of the value, and they are the two
// an automated suite is worst at showing:
//
//   · Panel 7b RENDERING. An out-of-credits screen has existed in this codebase
//     for months and nobody at Motir has ever seen it outside a fixture, because
//     the one organization using Motir hardest was the one org whose balance was
//     a WORD. Chapter 4 is that screen, for that org.
//   · The org CARRYING ON immediately afterwards. Asserted apart, those two facts
//     are much weaker than shown together: a screen that says you are out of
//     credits while you are demonstrably not blocked is the shape of the design,
//     and it is what a reviewer needs in order to believe the offset is real
//     rather than a suppression wearing new clothes.
//
// ── PACING IS DELIBERATE (AC 7) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each `beat` is a thing a person can actually see happen, and the chapters are
// ordered as one walk: the operator classifies, the customer's screens fill in,
// the two thresholds arrive, the org keeps working, the operator unclassifies.
// Nothing navigates that does not show something new. Do NOT "optimise" the
// holds out — the clip IS the deliverable here, more literally than usual.
//
// MEASURED at 54.5s, inside the ADR's ~60s guidance and far clear of the publish
// lane's 15s floor. Chapter starts: 1.0 / 7.8 / 18.6 / 25.2 / 32.1 / 47.5s, so
// the longest single phase is 15.4s and no stretch runs long enough to lose a
// viewer. Nine beats — the first cut had sixteen and timed out with the walk
// complete and its last beat unheld, which is why the two cheapest holds were
// given back to the chapters' own (see the dashboard and the closing move).
//
// ── ⚠️ AC 3 IS AMENDED, AND THE AMENDMENT IS THE HONEST HALF OF THE CLIP ────
//
// The card asks this spec to *"perform an action that a genuinely out-of-credits
// org would be refused, and watch it succeed."* It cannot, and staging it would
// be a lie told in the one artifact a human accepts the story from.
//
// The only balance-keyed refusal the product has is the AI paywall
// (`billingService.getAiAccess` → `balance <= 0`), and this story deliberately
// leaves it on `isMeta` — MOTIR-4573's own AC 5 FORBIDS `internalBilling` from
// appearing in `aiEntitlement.ts`, and `internal-billing-classification.md` §
// *"It lifts no cap and grants no entitlement"* says why: the classification
// decides what an org is CHARGED, never what it is ALLOWED. So an org that has
// genuinely reached zero is genuinely out of credits, and refusing it is
// correct.
//
// What makes *the org is never blocked* true is STRUCTURAL, not defended: the
// offset lands in the SAME transaction as the debit (MOTIR-4570), so a classified
// org's balance never falls in the first place. A browser cannot stage a state
// the ledger prevents. What it CAN show — and what chapter 5 shows — is that
// reaching that state gates nothing here: every control that was live at a
// healthy balance is still live at zero, asserted as a DIFFERENCE between the two
// renders rather than as a list that stops covering the page the day somebody
// adds a control, and the org performs a real product action while the paused
// banner is on screen.

const admin = enMessages.platformAdmin.orgs;

// ── ⚠️ AND THE CLIP RUNS IN ONE SESSION, ON PURPOSE (measured, not preferred) ─
//
// The first cut used a separate operator account and signed in and out three
// times; it timed out at 90s with the walk complete but the last beat unheld.
// Every one of those auth flows costs ~11s of a clip whose whole budget is ~85s,
// and none of them shows anything. So ONE person holds both roles here, and the
// platform gate is exercised by REMOVING their standing in the database rather
// than by re-authenticating as somebody else — the gate reads a fresh row per
// request, so the very next navigation sees it. That makes chapter 3 stronger
// rather than weaker: the same person, on the organization they OWN, gets the
// ordinary 404 the moment the standing goes.
