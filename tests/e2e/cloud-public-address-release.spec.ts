/*
 * RELEASING A WORKSPACE SUBDOMAIN — the browser-level acceptance
 * (Story MOTIR-4451 · Subtask MOTIR-4457).
 *
 * `acceptance-public-address.spec.ts` (MOTIR-4225) walks claim → add a custom
 * domain → certificate states → make primary → rename, with the old address
 * still redirecting. This spec is the step it could not reach because it did not
 * exist: **release**, and the reservation that outlives it.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ WHY A NEW SPEC RATHER THAN FOUR MORE CHAPTERS IN THAT ONE ───────────
 *
 * MOTIR-4457 says to EXTEND MOTIR-4225's lifecycle rather than start a second
 * one, and that instruction is about the FIXTURES and the way the pane is
 * reached — both of which this file takes from it, deliberately, down to the
 * read-the-identifier-back note below. It is not an instruction to edit that
 * file, because that file is an ACCEPTANCE RECEIPT for story MOTIR-3878:
 * `docs/decisions/acceptance-receipt-lifecycle.md` freezes a receipt once its
 * story is accepted, and appending this story's steps to it would both edit
 * history and film MOTIR-4451's work under MOTIR-3878's name.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THE CLOUD LANE, AND THE ONE VARIABLE IT WAS MISSING ─────────────────
 *
 * Public addresses are cloud-only (ADR §11), so this is a `cloud-*` spec and
 * runs in `playwright.cloud.config.ts`. That lane did NOT set
 * `MOTIR_PUBLIC_TENANT_DOMAIN`; without it the pane renders an operator
 * explanation and no claim field, and this walk would assert against that
 * instead of against the room. The variable is added there by this card, with
 * the same value the acceptance lane uses.
 *
 * The MOUNTING is SELF-DETECTING rather than merely argued: step 1's first
 * assertion is that the claim field is present, which the pane renders only when
 * a base domain is configured — so a lane that lost the variable fails loudly
 * instead of passing vacuously (the MOTIR-2601 shape, one lane over).
 *
 * ── ⚠️ WHAT THIS SPEC DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT ────────────────────────
 *
 * The REDIRECT behaviour of the released hostnames. A released address no longer
 * resolves at all, and the retired-alias `301` is MOTIR-4447's subject — an open
 * defect. Asserting it here would couple this spec to that bug's fix.
