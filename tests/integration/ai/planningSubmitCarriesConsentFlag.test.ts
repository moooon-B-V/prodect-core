// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// MOTIR-4343 — THE CONSENT FLAG RIDES EVERY PLANNING SUBMIT, INCLUDING THE ONES
// THAT BYPASS THE SHARED ONE
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// `Project.aiRecordPlanningMistakes` is a CONSENT setting: an org can switch off
// the planner recording what it got wrong. It crosses to motir-ai on the job
// envelope's `context` and nowhere else — motir-ai cannot read motir-core's
// database — and `mayRecordPlanningMistakes` (motir-ai `src/envelope.ts`) reads
// an ABSENT value as ON, deliberately, so a producer that predates the field
// keeps working.
//
// The consequence is the whole reason this file exists: **a submit that drops the
// field does not fail anywhere.** It is not a type error (there is no shared type
// across the boundary), it is not a runtime error, and it does not show up in a
// coverage report. It is a project's consent setting silently not being honoured.
//
// The defect it was written for: the flag was resolved INSIDE
// `aiPlanEditsService.submitPlanEditJob`, so the four entrances routing through
// that shared submit carried it and the two calling `submitJob` DIRECTLY —
// `aiGenerationService.startGeneration` and `aiPlanEditsService.submitRevise` —
// never resolved it at all. Both bypass the shared submit for real reasons (a
// revision holds a lease and opens no plan; generation opens its own), so the fix
// resolves the flag at each site rather than merging the paths — which is exactly
// the shape that can recur, and is why the second half of this file is a
// CALL-SITE guard rather than another behavioural case.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT EACH HALF CAN AND CANNOT SEE, because neither substitutes for the other:
//
//   1. THE VALUE ON THE WIRE (below). Drives a project with the setting switched
//      OFF through both entrances and asserts the submitted value is `false` —
//      the SETTING, not merely the key's presence. `storyGate.oneKindOnTheWire`
//      asserts presence across all six; presence with a hard-coded `true` would
//      pass that and defeat the feature entirely. It cannot see an entrance
//      nobody has written yet.
//   2. THE CALL SITES (the second describe). A static assertion over `lib/`,
//      derived from the call sites themselves rather than from a list of the
//      entrances that happen to exist today. It is what stops a SEVENTH entrance
//      reintroducing this by bypassing the shared submit again. It cannot see
//      what any of them actually SEND.
