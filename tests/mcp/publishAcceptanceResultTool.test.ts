// The object STORE is the only thing faked, and it is faked as a STORE — a map a

// `publishDesignResultTool.test.ts` spells out one artifact over:
// `recordFromPathnames` HEADs every pathname it is asked to register, precisely
// so a lying, absent or cross-tenant one cannot be recorded. A `headPrivateBlob`
// answering a fixed shape would make that check vacuous and quietly un-test the
// guarantee the register half exists for.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE MINT IS FAKED AS A GRANT, NOT AS A STRING. The real
// `mintPrivateUploadToken` returns a presigned PUT URL bound to one exact key
// and one content type; the tool's whole contract is that the agent uploads to
// the URL it was handed and registers the pathname it was handed. So the fake
// derives the URL FROM the pathname, and `putUploaded` below only accepts a
// pathname that was actually minted — a test that registers a pathname nobody
// granted would otherwise pass while the real service refused it.
