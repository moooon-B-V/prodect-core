// MOTIR-2316 — a design asset is a REFERRER to the app's addresses, and it is
// the only referrer no other check can see.
//
// ── The defect this guards ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// ADR `public-api-conventions.md` Amendment 9 Q1 renamed `/api-docs*` to
// `/docs*`, and it enumerated its own cost by grep rather than estimating it:
// the route directory, four in-product link sites, three ADR self-references,
// `lib/apiDocs/guide.ts`, ~14 vitest assertions across four files, eight URL
// waits in the E2E spec, the redirect map. Every one of those was updated.
// `design/api-docs/` was not on the list, and stayed two generations stale
// (Amendment 11 then moved the same pages again, to `/docs/api*`) until the
// next card to trust it as the layout source of truth noticed.
//
// Nothing failed, and nothing could have: a design asset is Markdown and HTML
// that no build resolves and no test opens, so its addresses live only in prose
// and in `href`s. A referrer sweep finds callers by grepping for the OLD name,
// which is precisely the string an asset still contains — the sweep's own
// method is what hides it.
//
// ── Why a test, and not the other two options ───────────────────────────────
// The card weighed three fixes:
//
//   1. THIS ONE — grep `design/**` for addresses that no longer resolve,
//      sourcing "what resolves" from the `app/**` route tree plus
//      `next.config.ts`'s `DOCS_REDIRECTS`.
//   2. A checklist line in the migration-card template. REJECTED: it is the
//      option that already failed. Amendment 9's cost table WAS the checklist,
//      written with more care than a template would get, and the asset still
//      was not on it.
//   3. Widening `plan-rules.md`'s migration limb so a referrer sweep names
//      `design/<area>/` alongside its call sites. REJECTED as the primary fix:
//      a rule has two homes (`plan-rules.md` and motir-ai's
//      `SHARED_PLANNING_RULES`), so it is a two-repo deliverable, and it still
//      depends on a human remembering to apply it at the moment of the rename.
//      `plan-rules.md`'s THIRD TIER prefers the mechanised check wherever the
//      check needs no judgement, and this one does not: an address either
//      resolves or it does not.
//
// ── What "no judgement" costs, and where the judgement went ─────────────────
// One place, deliberately: `KNOWN` below. A design asset is often drawn BEFORE
// the surface exists, so "this address resolves to nothing" is a legitimate
// state for a forward-looking asset — and assets also quote addresses in prose
// that are not links at all (a counterfactual the design rejected, a container
// filesystem path, a historical note about the very rename this guards). Each
// such pair is listed once, with a reason, by a human. The table is asserted
// TIGHT in both directions: an unlisted finding fails, and a listed entry that
// no longer fires fails too, so the list cannot rot into a mute button.

  //    MOTIR-2370 (#1916) diagnosed the same red `main` in parallel and both
  //    merged, so this table carried TWO rows for each of the eight pairs until
  //    MOTIR-2372 deduped them. The uniqueness test further down is what stops
  //    that recurring; read it before adding a row.
  //
  //    Every one of those eight rows is now GONE, and each left the same way:
  //    the card that BUILDS the route deleted its own rows in the commit that
  //    added the route — `/docs/cli` by MOTIR-2308 (#1910), `/docs/mcp` and
  //    `/docs/mcp/tools` by MOTIR-2309 (#1911). `expired()` below is what made
  //    that the only way out: a row survives exactly as long as the gap it
  //    describes, so it cannot quietly outlive the thing it excuses.
  //
  //    (MOTIR-2316's first run also parked 17 STALE pairs here — 13 assets
  //    addressing `/issues*` and `/login`. MOTIR-2340 corrected every one of
  //    them in the assets, so those rows are gone too.)

  // ── Forward-looking: the RUN VIEW (Story MOTIR-1789 · MOTIR-3895) ─────────
  //    `design/runs/` (MOTIR-1795) draws two surfaces that LINK to a run's own
  //    page, and that page does not exist yet: `app/(authed)/` holds no `runs`
  //    segment at all. MOTIR-3895 builds `/runs/[id]` and — per the pattern
  //    above — is the card that deletes these rows in the commit that adds the
  //    route, which `expired()` below enforces.
  //
  //    The link is the whole point of both surfaces rather than decoration: a
  //    ready-row strip that named a run without reaching it, and a card that
  //    said "4 of 11" without letting the reader see the other ten, would each
  //    be drawing the half of the answer that is already on the page.

    why: 'Forward-looking: the run view MOTIR-3895 builds. Named in the surface table as the third surface of this area, whose asset is MOTIR-3893’s.',
  },
  // ── Forward-looking: the two run PAGES (MOTIR-3893's asset) ──────────────
  //    The design draws the surfaces; MOTIR-3895 builds `/runs/[id]` and
  //    MOTIR-3923 builds `/runs` and its rail row. Each of these four rows
  //    DELETES ITSELF when its route lands — the `carries no KNOWN entry that
  //    has stopped applying` check above is what turns a stale exemption into a
  //    red build rather than a quiet one.
  {
    file: 'design/runs/run-modal.mock.html',
    address: '/runs/[id]',
    why: 'The route this asset says does NOT exist — cited only to record the withdrawal ("There is no /runs/[id] — the deep link is /runs?run=<id>"). It is the one address here that must NEVER resolve, so this row is PERMANENT and carries no delete-me instruction: if `app/(authed)/runs/[id]/page.tsx` ever lands, the asset is wrong rather than the row.',
  },

  //    ⚠️ TWO ROWS FOR `design/runs/ready-strip.mock.html` STOOD HERE AND ARE
  //    GONE WITH THE ASSET (MOTIR-3914). The strip drew a live-run indicator on
  //    a `/ready` row; that row cannot occur, because `/ready` lists only `todo`
  //    leaves and claiming a card flips it to `in_progress` before the first
  //    agent starts. The `carries no KNOWN entry that has stopped applying`
  //    check above is what caught them the moment the file was deleted — which
  //    is the whole reason these rows carry a deletion condition in their `why`.

  // ── Forward-looking: the Roles & permissions settings page (MOTIR-2263) ───
  //    The asset (MOTIR-2259, #1889) draws a settings page that does not exist
  //    yet: `app/(authed)/settings/project/` holds `members`, `board`,
  //    `automation`, `workflow` and the rest, but no `roles`. MOTIR-2263 builds
  //    the route and the registry entry, and — per the pattern above — is the
  //    card that deletes these three rows, in the commit that adds the route.
  //
  //    ⚠️ These rows exist because this guard did NOT run on the PR that made
  //    them necessary. `ci.yml` skips the Vitest job on `design/*`, so the one
  //    PR class that changes design assets is the one class that never runs the
  //    assets' own guards; #1889 merged green and `main` went red for the next
  //    `subtask/*` PR to run a full suite. That is the composition-red shape the
  //    MCP/CLI note above describes, arriving through a different door — not two
  //    PRs racing, but a gate that made one of them invisible. MOTIR-2442 closes
  //    it; MOTIR-2441 is this repair.
  // MOTIR-2263 SHIPPED THE ROUTES, so the three roles rows are gone — deleted by
  // the card that built them, exactly as their own `why` said they would be.
  // `/settings/project/roles` and `/settings/project/roles/[roleKey]` are real
  // pages now.
  //
  // ⚠️ And `/settings/project/roles/new` went with them, for a reason worth
  // stating: MOTIR-2257 has NOT built the create page, but `[roleKey]` is a
  // dynamic segment, so `new` matches it and the address resolves. It resolves
  // to a deliberate `notFound()` — `roles/[roleKey]/page.tsx` looks the segment
  // up in the catalog the service returns and 404s on a miss — which is the
  // right behaviour and is why the row's author pre-authorised this deletion
  // ("the route lands no earlier than MOTIR-2263"). The guard reads the ROUTE
  // TABLE, so a 404 rendered BY a matching route is invisible to it; that is a
  // known limit of the sweep, not something this deletion introduces.
  // MOTIR-2653 SHIPPED THE ROUTE, so the two `/home` rows are gone — deleted by
  // the card that built them, in the same commit, exactly as their own `why`
  // said they would be. `app/(authed)/home/page.tsx` is a real page now and both
  // assets' `/home` links resolve, so the pair is guarded again rather than
  // excused. (Contrast the point-in-time rows above, which are permanent: those
  // record an address that WAS live when the asset was drawn and has since moved
  // away, and nothing is ever coming back to change them.)

// The SOURCE-PATH sweep — MOTIR-2364
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// An asset names two kinds of thing, and everything above guards only one of
// them. It names ADDRESSES — where a surface lives for a user — and it names
// SOURCE PATHS: the shipped file the next agent is told to open, in lines that
// literally read "mirrors `app/(authed)/items/page.tsx`".
//
// ── The defect this guards ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The work-item rename moved `app/(authed)/issues/` to `app/(authed)/items/`
// and KEPT the component filenames, so `app/(authed)/issues/_components/
// issueCellPrimitives.tsx` was wrong in its first half and right in its
// second. Nineteen such citations across fourteen assets survived the rename,
// a referrer sweep (`issues` is still everywhere, legitimately, in
// `components/issues/` and `lib/issues/`), and the guard above.
//
// That guard could not have found them: a source path is not an address, and
// `toPageAddress` discards one twice over — exclusion (2) rejects anything
// whose last segment has a file extension (`page.tsx`), and `(authed)` is
// stripped from every route pattern, so `app/(authed)/…` can never match one.
// Invisible by construction, not by omission — hence a second sweep rather
// than a `KNOWN` row.
//
// ── Why this half is the load-bearing one ───────────────────────────────────
// An asset's addresses are read by a human orienting themselves. Its source
// paths are read by an agent about to write code. A dead address briefly
// confuses a reader; a dead source path sends a coding agent to open a file
// that does not exist — and what it does then is improvise the layout, which
// is the exact outcome the design-reference rule exists to prevent.

  // ── Forward-looking: the DISPATCH RUN decision record (MOTIR-1790) ────────
  //    Exactly the shape the note below records, one story later, and the same
  //    two rows for the same reason: `design/runs/` (MOTIR-1795) cites the ADR
  //    it is built to, the ADR is MOTIR-1790's deliverable, and the two reach
  //    `main` through DIFFERENT pull requests — the design ships alone because
  //    it is a STOPPER that needs sign-off before its dependents build on it,
  //    while the record rides the story's parent branch.
  //
  //    ⚠️ THESE TWO ROWS DELETE THEMSELVES when the parent pull request brings
  //    `docs/decisions/dispatch-run-record.md` into the tree. `carries no
  //    KNOWN_PATHS entry that has stopped applying` below is what turns that
  //    into a red build rather than a stale exemption — nobody has to remember.

  // (The two FORWARD-LOOKING rows for `docs/decisions/work-item-todo-list.md`
  //  lived here for exactly as long as their own `why` said they would. The
  //  asset cites the ADR, the ADR is MOTIR-3811's deliverable, and the two
  //  reached `main` through different pull requests — so for the length of the
  //  design PR the citation named a file that branch did not carry. Both rows
  //  expired the moment the parent branch brought the record into the tree, and
  //  `carries no KNOWN_PATHS entry that has stopped applying` is what turned
  //  that into a red build rather than a stale exemption. The citations are
  //  guarded like any other from here.)

  // (Three rows sat here and all three deleted themselves with this branch,
  //  exactly as their own `why` instructed:
  //    * `components/ui/Checkbox.tsx`  — created by MOTIR-2465;
  //    * `lib/permissions/limits.ts` x2 — created by MOTIR-2472, exempted while
  //      the DESIGN STOPPER merged ahead of this code branch.
  //  All three paths now resolve, so each is a real citation again and is
  //  guarded like any other. An exemption cannot outlive its reason — and the
  //  `carries no KNOWN_PATHS entry that has stopped applying` test below is
  //  what made sure nobody had to remember.)
  // MOTIR-2653 CREATED `app/(authed)/home/page.tsx`, so its forward-looking row
  // is gone — deleted by the card that built the file, in the same commit.
  // (Story 8.9's two rows lived here for one commit and deleted themselves the
  //  moment 8.9.1's decision record joined this branch — which is what their own
  //  `why` said would happen, enforced by the tight test below rather than by
  //  anyone remembering.)
  // MOTIR-1136 CREATED `app/(authed)/settings/account/data/page.tsx`, so
  // MOTIR-3680's forward-looking row is gone — deleted by the card that built
