// MOTIR-3144 — the guard ON the structural-guard lane.
//
// ── What this file exists to prevent ────────────────────────────────────────
// The lane is an explicit `include` list, which is the right shape (a glob over
// `tests/rls/**` would sweep up the two guards that legitimately need a
// database) and the wrong shape for staying complete. A whole-tree guard written
// next month lands in `tests/**`, runs inside the sharded database job by
// default, and nothing says otherwise until it times out on somebody else's pull
// request — which is precisely the bug this card fixed, one level up.
//
// So membership is DERIVED here and compared against the list. A new guard fails
// this test, with the file named, until it is either added to the lane or
// declared in `DATABASE_BOUND_GUARDS` with a reason.
//
// ── The predicate, and the line it deliberately draws ───────────────────────
// A file is a CANDIDATE when it imports a module under `tests/` that reaches
// the filesystem for a WHOLE-TREE answer.
//
// ⚠️ WIDENED BY MOTIR-3497, from the IMPORT to the PROPERTY. This test used to
// ask whether a module parsed the tree *with the TypeScript compiler API*, and
// that is a question about the implementation a guard happens to use rather
// than about the thing that makes one flake — doing whole-tree filesystem work
// under a budget sized for a database query, on a contended shard.
//
// `tests/coverage-gate-globs.test.ts` is what the gap cost. It resolves the
// whole `coverage.include` set with `tinyglobby` — 483 files, ~0.8 s quiet —
// and parses nothing, so the compiler-API predicate answered false and it
// stayed in the sharded run, where it timed out three times in four days at the
// 15 s `testTimeout` with zero assertion failures. A membership check that
// enumerates the scanner family it knows about is the same shape as the class
// it guards: a check that enumerates instances.
//
// So membership now derives from `FILESYSTEM_ENTRY_POINTS` — `readdirSync`, the
// awaited and streaming forms, `node:fs`'s `globSync`, `tinyglobby` /
// `fast-glob` / `globby`, `git ls-files`, and the compiler API — each carrying
// the reason it is a carrier, in `tests/helpers/structuralGuardLane.ts`.
//
// ── The second axis, and why it is DECLARED rather than derived ─────────────
// The entry-point set answers *does this touch the filesystem*. The lane is for
// *does this touch the WHOLE TREE*, and no regex reads that off a call site:
// `join(repoRoot, 'app')` and `join(repoRoot, 'app', 'api', 'v1')` are one path
// segment apart and three orders of magnitude apart in cost. So a module whose
// answer is bounded DECLARES itself in `BOUNDED_SCAN_MODULES` with the bound
// named, and this file checks that the declaration is about a real file that
// really does hold an entry point. Silence is not a declaration: a new module
// with an entry point and no entry there makes its importers candidates, and a
// candidate in neither the lane nor `DATABASE_BOUND_GUARDS` fails this test by
// name.
//
// ⚠️ Deliberately still NOT "everything under tests/rls/". That directory holds
// database-backed policy suites as well as scanners, and three of the four
// `DATABASE_BOUND_GUARDS` exceptions are in it. Naming a directory would have
// been easier and would have been wrong.
//
// ⚠️ AND still NOT "any test file that calls readdirSync". Measured on this
// tree, that predicate matches EIGHTY-TWO files — story gates, database-backed
// integration suites, component tests that read one fixture directory. Most
// walk a handful of directories and have never been implicated in a timeout.
// The lane's SELF-walking members (the rate-limit, ink-contrast, viewport and
// import-graph guards, which do their own walk instead of importing a scanner)
// are therefore listed explicitly and asserted present below, rather than
// derived. That half is recorded on MOTIR-3144 and unchanged here.
