// MOTIR-4743 — the hero AI control's STYLE SEAM, and the closure rule that keeps
// a design-named surface from existing only on paper.
//
// ── The defect ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `design/ai-chat/design-notes.md` § *The hero control is STYLE-AWARE* promised a
// per-style treatment for the "Plan with AI" pill and the floating M orb, and
// prescribed the mechanism: `[data-style='id'] [data-surface='ai-cta'] { … }`.
// Three independent things made that unreachable:
//
//   1. NO element emitted `data-surface="ai-cta"` — the string existed only
//      inside `design/`, so the prescribed selector had nothing to select;
//   2. the FILL was an INLINE `background-image`, which beats every stylesheet
//      rule, so a rule written after fixing (1) would still have been inert;
//   3. the one seam that did exist (`--plan-hero-shadow` / `--plan-orb-shadow`,
//      MOTIR-3522) covered `box-shadow` and one style.
//
// So under all eleven registered styles the pill was the same violet gradient
// with the same pink halo and only its RADIUS moved.
//
// ── Why a SOURCE guard, and what goes to the browser instead ────────────────
// The same split `immersiveShellChrome.test.ts` and `styleShellCanvas.test.ts`
// make, and it binds here for the same reason: the properties under test are
// `var()`-bearing fills inside `@scope` blocks, and no DOM implementation
// available to the unit lane resolves either — a `var()` colour reads back as
// `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` and `@scope` is not implemented at all — so a
// computed-style assertion here is green on the broken source AND on the fixed
// one. This lane asserts the WIRING: the hook, the seam, the derived style set,
// and the closure rule. The RENDERED half — every style's measured fill, border,
// shadow and type against the base style's own computed values — lives in
// `tests/e2e/hero-ai-control-styles.spec.ts`, where a real browser resolves both.
//
// ── The CLOSURE RULE this file adds (the `specified → emitted` direction) ────
// MOTIR-4252 §4b and MOTIR-4406's guard close `emitted → classified`: they
// derive the `data-surface` population the app EMITS and fail on any member the
// plane ladder leaves unclassified. That guard is structurally blind to THIS
// defect — `ai-cta` was named in a design and emitted nowhere, so the population
// it reads had no member to classify. The test below closes the other direction,
// which is what stops the next design-named surface from quietly never existing.
