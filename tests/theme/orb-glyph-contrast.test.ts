// MOTIR-3207 — the floating orb's glyph-on-gradient contrast
// (`design/ai-chat/design-notes.md` § *B*, `ai-callout-menu.mock.html` panel 9).
//
// ── WHY THIS TEST EXISTS AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Same hole as its sibling `brand-tile-contrast.test.ts`, one step deeper. The
// repo's ink guard (`tests/theme/inkContrastLint.test.ts`) reasons about the
// ink/surface tokens it finds named together in a `className`. Here the ink IS
// in a className (`text-(--el-accent-text)`) but the backdrop is not a token at
// all — it is a STOP inside a `radial-gradient()` in a JS style object, and the
// stop is a `color-mix()` of the ink into the fill. No className-reading guard
// can see that pair, so the orb shipped for three weeks with a white mark at
// 2.78:1 on the brightest part of its own gradient.
//
// ── THE SAMPLE POINT IS THE FIRST STOP, AND THAT IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED ───
// The gradient's first stop is its lightest point by construction — it mixes
// the GLYPH's own colour into the fill — and it is centred at 33%/27%, well
// inside the 26 px glyph box in the 56 px circle. So it is where a white mark
// is closest to disappearing, and a mid-tone assertion (the orb BODY, which
// measures 4.99:1 in default dark) reads green over a failing surface. The
// suite therefore measures all three stops and asserts the first is the worst,
// so a future palette that inverts that ordering fails HERE rather than making
// the chosen sample point quietly wrong.
//
// ── AND IT ASSERTS EVERY PALETTE, NOT JUST THE DEFAULT ──────────────────────
// This is where the card that filed the defect was wrong, so it is worth
// stating. The finding measured the default pair and concluded "light has
// headroom at 32%, so prefer a theme-aware mix". Across the whole shipped
// matrix — ten `data-palette` values x both themes — FOUR contexts failed at
// 32% and one of them, `evergreen`, is a LIGHT one at 2.94:1. A
// `[data-theme='dark']` override of the stop would have left it broken. The fix
// is one global `--orb-lit-mix: 26%`, and this is the guard that makes the
// claim "all twenty clear 3:1" a fact rather than a sentence.
//
// WCAG 1.4.11 (non-text contrast) asks 3:1 for a graphical object that carries
// meaning. All 20 contexts clear it; the lowest is the default dark, at 3.09:1.
//
// NOT in scope, deliberately: the orb's `inset 0 1px 0 color-mix(…40%…)` rim.
// It is a 1 px line on the circle's top EDGE, outside the centred glyph box, so
// it is not a backdrop the mark is read against.
