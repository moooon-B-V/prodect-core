// MOTIR-4353 — the CLASS guard for MOTIR-4318, whose seven sibling sweeps moved
// eleven assets onto the `--el-*` layer. This is the twelfth card: it stops a
// twelfth ASSET being written the way those eleven were.
//
// ── The defect the class is made of ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Eleven `*.mock.html` files opened with a `:root` block that copied the design
// system's values onto PRIVATE names, usually annotating each line with the
// token it stood for:
//
//     :root {
//       --text:  #1a1a1a;   /* --el-text */
//       --muted: #787671;   /* --el-text-muted */
//       --faint: #a4a097;   /* --el-text-faint */
//     }
//
// The values were right, which is what made it look harmless, and the comment
// naming the correct token made it look deliberate. Three things a raw hex
// cannot do: flip with `data-palette`, follow a re-skin, or be MEASURED. Every
// ink guard in the tree keys on `--el-*` read off the declaration AT THE PAINT
// SITE — `design-ink-contrast` (RESTING) and `design-state-ink-contrast`
// (STATE, MOTIR-4255) — so `color: var(--muted)` is not measured leniently, it
// is not measured at all. Those guards' green was a statement about the set
// they could see. `CLAUDE.md` § *NEVER INVENT A COLOUR* already forbade the
// pattern (MOTIR-2455); a rule nothing measures decays at the rate people
// forget it, and eleven assets carried it anyway.
//
// ── TWO limbs, and the second is the one the class is actually about ────────
//   (a) DECLARATION — every `*.mock.html` declares at least one `--el-*`
//       custom property. Necessary, and on its own NOT sufficient.
//   (b) NO PRIVATE COLOUR ALIAS — no `*.mock.html` declares a custom property
//       that is neither `--el-*` nor a name the design system itself declares,
//       whose value is a bare colour literal.
//
// Limb (a) alone is satisfiable by an asset that declares one token and aliases
// everything else — a file that passes the guard and is exactly as unmeasurable
// as the eleven. `design/ai-chat/planning-workspace.mock.html` is that file,
// and this guard found it on its first run (MOTIR-4428, held in
// `UNSWEPT_ASSETS` below).
//
// ── Why it is a spec and not a rule ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Same reason as `design-three-file-set.test.ts` (MOTIR-3069), whose file walk,
// fixture-tree pattern and hold-it-tight table this file reuses: the rule was
// written down twice and violated anyway, because the only thing checking it
// was somebody remembering.
