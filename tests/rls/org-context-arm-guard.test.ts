// The ORG-CONTEXT ARM guard (MOTIR-2959) — the same question one axis over.
//
//   singleton-read-guard      — can this read be bound?         (a `tx` parameter)
//   call-site-guard           — do its callers bind it?         (a `tx` argument)
//   bare-transaction-guard    — what did the transaction bind?  (a `set_config`)
//   system-context-arm-guard  — does a policy read `app.system_admin`?
//   THIS ONE                  — does a policy read `app.organization_id`?
//
// ── Why it exists, and why it is a SECOND guard rather than more sites ──────
// MOTIR-2956: the free-tier 2 GB storage cap silently never fired, for any
// organization, on any tier with a finite cap. `entitlementsService
// .assertWithinStorageCap` opened `withOrgServiceWriteContext`, bound
// `app.organization_id`, and summed `attachment` ⨝ `workspace` — neither of
// which had a policy reading that GUC. The sum came back 0 and 0 is under every
// cap. Above those three lines sat a comment naming that exact failure mode: the
// safeguard and the defect were the same three lines, and every reviewer who
// looked at them saw an author who had understood the risk.
//
// That card SWEPT the family by hand — twelve call sites, one broken, eleven
// written down in `docs/rls-runtime-role-inventory.md`. **A hand sweep is a
// snapshot.** The thirteenth call site, or a JOIN added to an existing
// repository method, restores the class in silence. This guard is the sweep
// re-derived on every run, which is the difference between a document and a
// ratchet.
//
// ⚠️ THE ASSERTION IS PER (TABLE, CONTEXT) AND IT READS `pg_policies`, NOT THE
// MIGRATIONS — `tests/rls/policyArms.ts`, which also records what that inventory
// can and cannot answer.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT ADJUDICATES THE WHOLE QUERY, NOT THE FROM CLAUSE. `notes.html` #269,
// and here it is load-bearing rather than theoretical: `sumSizeByOrganization`
// is `FROM "attachment" JOIN "workspace"`, so arming `attachment` alone would
// have left the sum at zero — the fix reading as applied while changing nothing.
// `the JOIN target is adjudicated too` below proves the guard sees it, by
// reconstructing the arm set as it stood before that migration.
