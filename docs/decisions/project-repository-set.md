# The project's REPOSITORY SET — cardinality, roles, seeding, ownership, and who pins the repo

**Status:** accepted · **Date:** 2026-07-30 · **Card:** MOTIR-1776 (Story MOTIR-1775 —
establish the repository set at plan approval) · **Evidence pinned at:** `motir-core`
`origin/main` @ `c3d3ac7e`, `motir-ai` `origin/main` @ `93afca4`

**Amended:** 2026-07-30 (Yue · MOTIR-1893) — **§3 ownership**: a new project's repositories
are **always** created under Motir's org, for every user. The original what-the-user-HAS
branch (§3.1–§3.2, and §3.3's framing as a no-identity fallback) is **superseded**; it is
kept below, marked, with the reversal recorded in
[the amendment](#amendment-2026-07-30-yue--motir-1893--a-new-projects-repos-are-always-motir-owned).
Nothing in §0–§2 or §4–§6 changes.

**Amended:** 2026-07-31 (Yue · MOTIR-1930) — **§3's tenancy consequence**: because every
project's repos now sit behind ONE shared installation, the mirror's `installation → workspace`
binding no longer identifies a tenant. `github_repo` gains its own `workspace_id`,
`github_installation.workspace_id` becomes nullable, every delivery resolves its workspace
through the REPO row, and the shared installation never reconciles. Recorded in
[the tenancy amendment](#amendment-2026-07-31-yue--motir-1930--the-provisioning-orgs-mirror-is-per-workspace-and-tenancy-moves-onto-the-repo-row).
It **overturns nothing** — §3 and its 2026-07-30 amendment stand unchanged; this closes what
they cost. Nothing in §0–§2 or §4–§6 changes.

**Amended:** 2026-07-31 (Yue · MOTIR-1943) — **§3 gains TEAM ACCESS**: the ownership
amendment left every member except the approving user locked out of a private, Motir-owned
repository. This decides WHO is invited (the members the shipped `canEdit` policy already
lets edit the project), at WHAT permission (`push` per invitee; `admin` stays the owner's),
WHO sees the connect prompt (each member, for their own identity only), WHERE the surface
lives (project settings, at _Access & members_), and whether the CI-spend exposure needs a
new guard (it does not — recorded so that none is built). Recorded in
[the team-access amendment](#amendment-2026-07-31-yue--motir-1943--team-access-who-else-gets-into-the-code-at-what-permission-and-where-the-door-is).
It **supersedes nothing** — it answers a question §3 left open. Nothing in §0–§2 or §4–§6
changes.

The recorded architecture every other card in MOTIR-1775 builds to. It decides six
things: what fixes the **number** of repositories a project has (§0), the **role**
vocabulary and naming (§1), what **seeds** a repo the default starter does not fit (§2),
**where** the repos are created and who owns them (§3), the per-row **lifecycle** and what
partial failure means (§4), and **who pins** the repo each work item ships in (§5). §6
shows the single-repo project falling out of the same model.

## Context

A Motir project needs somewhere for its code to live, and nothing in the shipped product
ever establishes it: the start-fresh journey ends at an approved plan with no repository,
no connection and no code graph. Story MOTIR-1775 closes that gap at plan approval.

The question this ADR exists to answer first is the one the Story's v1 got wrong. It was
authored as _"one repo per project"_, and ten subtasks were built on that cardinality
before Yue rejected the premise: **a project that separates frontend and backend is two
repositories; add a shared package and it is three; a monorepo is one.** How many repos a
project has is a property of its **architecture**, so the establish step must produce a
SET whose cardinality comes from the plan.

That was the _second_ occurrence of one class — the same collapse was flagged on the
MOTIR-930 migrate-onboarding wizard design, which had reduced the flow to a single
`acme/web`, and produced the recorded rule _"a Motir project usually spans MORE THAN ONE
repository (a web app + an API + a shared package); any migrate / code-graph / audit /
code-aware-plan surface must be designed multi-repo, not 'one project = one repo'."_ An
ADR that assumes one repo would be the third.

### What is actually shipped — verified, not assumed

| There is **no project-level architecture record** — no model, no column. Nothing anywhere says "this project is web + api".                                                                                                                             | `prisma/schema.prisma` (grep: no `architecture`, no `projectClass`, no `platform` column)              |
| The connected repo set is **workspace-scoped and has no project link**: `GithubInstallation` belongs to a workspace and owns many `GithubRepo` rows, which carry `owner` / `name` / `defaultBranch` only                                                | `prisma/schema.prisma`, `model GithubInstallation` / `model GithubRepo`                                |
| A precise repo↔project association is explicitly an **unbuilt future refinement** — a repo installed at a workspace is indexed into _every_ project of that workspace                                                                                   | `lib/services/codeGraphIndexService.ts:24-31`                                                          |
| The planning envelope's code slot is already **plural** — `context.code.repos[]`, resolved server-side from the installation mirror                                                                                                                     | `lib/ai/codeContext.ts:24-61`                                                                          |
| The per-item pin is shipped: `work_item.targetRepo` holds a bare repo NAME, validated against the workspace's connected set, resolved at dispatch as _pin → the workspace's **single** connected repo → `null`_                                         | `lib/workItems/targetRepo.ts:99-131`, `docs/decisions/target-repo-attribution.md`                      |
| A generated plan **pins nothing**. `PlanItemProposedFields` carries `title` / `kind` / `descriptionMd` / `type` / `priority` / `executor` / sizing / explanation / provenance — and **no repo field**                                                   | `lib/dto/plans.ts`, `PlanItemProposedFields`                                                           |
| Neither does the generator's output schema — its proposal node has `type` / `priority` / `executor` / `blockedByRefs` and no repo field, though its prose rules tag repos per card                                                                      | `motir-ai/src/llm/treeGeneration.ts` (proposal JSON schema; `SHARED_PLANNING_RULES`)                   |
| The product's own planner already assumes multi-repo: _"ONE SUBTASK = ONE REPO = ONE PR"_, _"in a multi-repo product almost every card's runtime path crosses a repo boundary — that is the ARCHITECTURE"_, _"whatever the project's repo boundary is"_ | `motir-ai/src/llm/treeGeneration.ts`, `SHARED_PLANNING_RULES`                                          |
| The pre-plan session — the only place a project's shape is recorded — holds `classification`, `platform`, `designStarter`, `designChoice`, and lives in **motir-ai**, read by core over `GET /v1/preplan`                                               | `lib/ai/types.ts:392-410`, `lib/services/aiPreplanService.ts:47-57`                                    |
| There is **one** default platform starter — a full-stack Next.js + Prisma + Vercel web app. The `-with-design` variant is **retired and archived**; the bare starter now imports `@motir/design-system`                                                 | `nextjs-prisma-vercel-starter/README.md`, `nextjs-prisma-vercel-starter-with-design/README.md`         |
| The identity grant is **identity only** and grants no repo access; repo access is the separate installation grant                                                                                                                                       | `prisma/schema.prisma`, `model GithubIdentity` doc-comment; `lib/services/githubIdentityService.ts:11` |

Two things follow immediately. **The inputs for a repo plan exist but are thin** — a
class, a platform, a starter flag, and a generated tree, none of which names an
architecture. And **the plan → dispatch path is broken above one repo**: with two or more
connected repos and no pin, `resolveDispatchTargetRepo` returns `null` by design, and no
agent is told where to build. That second fact is why §5 exists.

## Decision

### §0 — The cardinality comes from the plan, PROPOSED by Motir and CONFIRMED by the user

**The repo set is derived, presented as editable rows, and fixed by the user's
confirmation at the establish step. Motir proposes; the user decides.**

**0.1 · What the proposal is derived from**, in this order, each step falling through when
its signal is absent:

1. **Role signals in the generated tree.** The plan is the only artifact that describes
   what is actually being built, and the planner already reasons in repo boundaries. Under
   §5 each proposed item carries a **role**; the distinct roles present in the tree ARE the
   proposed set. This is the primary signal, and it is the one that makes a
   frontend/backend split produce two rows without anybody being asked a question.
2. **Platform**, from the pre-plan session (`platform`: `web` / `mobile` / `other`) — it
   fixes what the primary row's role is when the tree is thin or absent.
3. **The chosen starter** (`designStarter`) — it fixes what the `web` row seeds from (§2).
4. **Default: exactly one row, role `web`.** When the signals are thin — a project with no
   pre-plan session (a migrated or seeded project reads `session: null`), a tree whose
   cards carry no roles — the proposal is a single web repo, because that is what the
   default starter is.

One row the user can add to is **truthful**. A silently-guessed three-row set is not: it
would create repositories the user never asked for in an account they own.

**0.2 · Who has final say: the user, at the establish step.** Principle #3 — the plan is
editable before coding starts — applies to the repo set exactly as it does to the tree.
The set is presented with every row editable (add, remove, rename, change role, switch to
connect-existing) and nothing is created until it is confirmed.

**0.3 · No upstream ARCHITECTURE record is created. The confirmed repo set IS the
architecture decision's home.** This is settled, not left implied.

A first-class `ProjectArchitecture` record was considered and **rejected**:

- **Its entire content would be the repo set.** Every field such a record would carry is
  either already in the pre-plan session (class, platform, starter) or is precisely a
  column of the set (role, name, seed source). A record whose content is the repo set _is_
  the repo set under a second name, and two registries drift — the same argument that
  rejected a second repo registry in `docs/decisions/target-repo-attribution.md` §1.
- **A derived record would freeze a guess as if it were a decision.** `targetRepo`'s ADR
  §3 already settled this shape: _"baking today's default into every row would freeze a
  GUESS in a column whose whole purpose is to record a DECISION — and afterwards the two
  would be indistinguishable."_ An architecture record populated by the §0.1 derivation has
  exactly that defect. The repo set avoids it because the derivation is only a
  **proposal**: the user's edit and confirmation is a real decision event, with an actor
  and a timestamp, and it happens before anything is written.
- **It would have no second consumer.** Nothing in the current plan reads an architecture
  record that could not read the set. Filing a card for it would be inventing work — the
  mirror of the orphaned-deferral defect (MOTIR-1826 / MOTIR-1834), and the same reasoning
  `docs/decisions/code-access-for-planning.md` used to file no implementation cards for a
  "no" decision.

**The trigger that would justify revisiting it is named, so it is recognisable:** an
architecture fact that is **not a repo boundary** (an event-driven vs request/response
choice, a deployment topology) or one needed **before or without** repos (a project whose
rows are all skipped, yet whose plan must still be shaped by its architecture). Neither
exists today. If one arrives, the record is a new card and this section is amended — not a
hole someone quietly fills.

### §1 — Roles are a small fixed enum plus a free-form label; names are derived and editable

**1.1 · The role vocabulary is a fixed enum of six values, plus an optional free-form
label per row:**

| Role     | What it means                                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `web`    | A browser-facing application (the default platform starter's shape)        |
| `api`    | A backend service exposing an API — a separated backend, or one of several |
| `mobile` | A native / cross-platform mobile app                                       |
| `shared` | A library or package consumed by the other repos                           |
| `infra`  | Infrastructure-as-code, deployment, CI-only content                        |
| `other`  | The honest escape hatch — a CLI, a desktop app, a docs site                |

An enum, not free text, because **the role drives real behaviour** — it selects what the
repo is seeded from (§2), and it is the join key the item pin resolves through (§5). An
open string cannot do either without a lookup table that would be the enum, less safely.
The **free-form label** carries what the enum deliberately does not: `api` + label
"billing" versus `api` + label "search".

**1.2 · A role MAY appear more than once.** Two services are two `api` rows distinguished
by their labels and names. Nothing in the model treats roles as unique, and forbidding
repetition would push a service-oriented backend into `other`, losing the seeding
behaviour the role exists to select. §5's pin therefore resolves through the row, not the
role alone, whenever a role repeats (see §5.3).

**1.3 · ORDER is meaningful, and the first row is the project's primary repo.** It is what
a single-repo project's one row is, what the UI names when it speaks of "your project's
repository", and the deterministic tie-break anywhere a set needs one. Order carries **no
dispatch meaning** — an item is never routed by position.

**1.4 · Names.** A proposed repo is named `<project-slug>` when the set has exactly one
row, and `<project-slug>-<role>` once it has two or more (`acme` → `acme-web`, `acme-api`).
No suffix noise on the common case; an unambiguous, guessable name as soon as there is
something to disambiguate. When a role repeats, the label joins the name
(`acme-api-billing`), slugified. **Every name is editable per row**, always, and an edited
name is never re-derived behind the user's back.

**1.5 · Collisions never dead-end a row.** When the target account already holds a repo of
that name, Motir offers the same name with a numeric suffix (`acme-web-2`, then `-3`),
**pre-filled and editable, before the row is created**, and the other rows are unaffected.
_Whether_ availability is learned from a pre-check or from the creation attempt's own
error is a GitHub mechanic this ADR does not assert — MOTIR-1777 (d) settles it. The
user-visible behaviour above is fixed either way.

### §2 — Seeding is per row, per role, and admits where a repo starts near-empty

There is **one** default platform starter and it is a full-stack Next.js web app. It
cannot seed an API-only or a shared-package repo, and the multi-stack scaffold registry is
Epic 9's (MOTIR-709 / 9.3.5), out of scope here. So:

| Role                                        | Seeded from                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `web`                                       | The default platform starter — `nextjs-prisma-vercel-starter` (which imports `@motir/design-system`)          |
| `api`, `mobile`, `shared`, `infra`, `other` | An **initialised** repo: a README naming the project and the row's role, a licence, a `.gitignore`, a CI stub |

**A non-web repo starts near-empty, and the flow says so rather than implying a scaffold
that does not exist.** This is acceptable, not a compromise to hide: the plan's own rules
already slice a backend into _schema/migration → repository → service → route_
(`SHARED_PLANNING_RULES`), so the first card dispatched into that repo builds its
skeleton — which is what a scaffold would have guessed at, done by an agent that has read
the plan.

**The seed source is recorded per row as a string**, not as a boolean or an enum of two.
When MOTIR-709 lands, a row's seed source becomes a starter-registry key and this table
becomes its default map — no migration, no second code path.

**One correction to record:** `aiPreplanService` writes `designStarter: 'bare'` on a
design pick versus `'with-design'` on a skip, describing two starters. There is now one —
`nextjs-prisma-vercel-starter-with-design` is retired and archived (its own README says
so), and the bare starter ships the design system. Both values therefore resolve to the
same starter for a `web` row; the flag survives as the record of the user's design _choice_,
not as a repo selector.

### §3 — Ownership is decided ONCE for the whole set

> **⚠️ Read the amendment below first.** §3.1, §3.2 and §3.3's fallback framing are
> **SUPERSEDED** by the 2026-07-30 amendment at the end of this section; §3.4 and §3.5
> survive with the readings the amendment fixes. The superseded text is kept verbatim
> because an ADR records how the thinking changed, not only where it landed.

**3.1 · ~~GitHub identity connected → the repos are created in the user's own account, as
them.~~** _(Superseded 2026-07-30.)_ Theirs from the first commit: no transfer, no
acceptance step, no lock-in.

**3.2 · ~~When the user administers several organizations, the target account is a single
choice for the SET, defaulting to their personal account~~**, _(Superseded 2026-07-30 —
there is no account choice for a created row; the target is always Motir's org.)_ and it
is recorded on the project alongside the set — not per row. A personal-account default is
the one that always works: org repo-creation is frequently governed, and defaulting to an
org would make the common case fail for a policy reason the user did not choose.

**3.3 · No GitHub identity → the repos are created under Motir's org, recorded as
Motir-owned and CLAIMABLE.** The non-technical user is not a different journey — same
step, same outcome, with the claim path available whenever they want it. _(Amended
2026-07-30: the OUTCOME stands and is now universal — every created repo is Motir-owned
and claimable. Only the trigger is superseded: this is no longer the no-identity branch of
a fork, it is **the** create path, for every user.)_

**3.4 · "Claimable" is recorded as project-scoped data, not as something to be
rediscovered.** The set carries an **ownership** value (`user` / `motir`) plus the target
account login. MOTIR-711 (9.3.7)'s transfer flow finds every claimable repo of a project
with one project-scoped read, and transfers **the whole set together** — never a GitHub
account scan, never a per-repo hunt. _(Unchanged, with the amendment's reading: a
**created** row is always `motir`; `user` now arises only from a **connect-existing** row,
or from a set that 9.3.7 has already transferred.)_

**3.5 · A set is never half in the user's account and half in Motir's.** A row that cannot
be created in the chosen target fails **as a row** (§4) and falls back to connect-existing
or skip; it does **not** silently retarget to Motir's org. A silent retarget would split
the ownership of one project's code across two accounts on an error path, and 9.3.7's
transfer would then be a partial answer that looks complete. If the user wants a different
target, they change it for the set and re-run the step. _(Amended 2026-07-30: the
invariant holds and gets easier to keep — every created row targets the same Motir org, so
the only way a set mixes ownership is the user deliberately connecting one of their own
repos as a row. The failure rule is unchanged: a row that cannot be created fails as a row
and is retried, connected, or skipped.)_

#### Amendment 2026-07-30 (Yue · MOTIR-1893) — a new project's repos are ALWAYS Motir-owned

**The decision.** **Every repository Motir CREATES for a new project is created under
Motir's own organization, for both audiences, with no branch on what the user has.** The
Motir org is no longer a fallback; it is the default and only home for a newly created
repo. What follows creation is the explicit take-it-over path (MOTIR-711 / 9.3.7), which
this decision promotes from an edge-case escape hatch to the standard way a project's code
ends up in the user's own account.

**Connect-existing is untouched.** It remains the only path that reaches a repository the
user owns, and it keeps the shipped installation hand-off (`githubInstallationManageUrl()`
— repo selection is changed on GitHub's install screen, never faked in-app). A user who
already has code still connects it, exactly as before.

**Why — three reasons, recorded with their evidence:**

**1 · Two audiences, one path.** The non-technical user never touches GitHub: they
validate the work on the site Motir built, while the code and the PM record sit ready to
be taken over if the team grows. The technical user runs agents locally and may use the
hosted agent. A branch keyed on _"do you have GitHub?"_ made the first case an edge case
of the second — a second flow to design, build, test, and support, differing on the one
axis the user cares least about. Removing the branch makes the establish step identical
for everyone, which is what MOTIR-1778's design already draws ("Motir hosts your code" as
the default, "Use your own GitHub instead" as the quiet secondary that leads to
connect-existing).

**2 · It avoids a permission escalation that would have cost the install funnel.**
Creating a repository in a user's account requires the App permission Repository
**`Administration: write`** (the spike's Mechanic 1 table). Three documented facts make
that expensive, and they compound:

- **Permissions are fixed at the App REGISTRATION, not per user.**
  [Choosing permissions for a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/choosing-permissions-for-a-github-app),
  verbatim: _"When you register a GitHub App, you can select permissions for the app."_ So
  the permission set is a property of the App every installer sees — there is no
  per-install, per-user, or per-flow subset. (GitHub has no optional-permission mechanism;
  the community's own summary of the gap, in the unanswered discussion
  [#51105](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/51105) _"Any way to define
  optional GitHub app permissions?"_, is _"scope permissions are given in their entirety or
  the login flow fails."_ **Stated as what it is: a user's conclusion in an unanswered
  community thread, not GitHub documentation** — the documented facts are the two quoted
  here and the re-consent quotes below.)
- **An App that asks for it can no longer be installed by a repository admin.**
  [Installing a GitHub App from a third party](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-a-github-app-from-a-third-party),
  verbatim: _"Repository admins can install GitHub Apps in the organization that owns the
  repository if the app does not request any organization permissions nor the 'repository
  administration' permission."_ Requesting it therefore narrows installation to
  **organization owners** — a hard funnel loss for every team whose evaluator is a repo
  admin rather than an owner.
- **Adding it to the SHIPPED App is a two-sided re-consent, not a config change.** From
  [Editing a GitHub App's permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/editing-a-github-apps-permissions),
  quoted in the spike: _"Each account where the app is installed will need to approve the
  new permissions."_ · _"…each user that has authorized the app will need to approve the
  permission changes."_ · _"Updated permissions won't take effect on an installation or
  user authorization until the new permissions are approved."_ Every existing installation
  and every already-connected user would have had to re-approve before creation worked for
  them.

The cost was therefore paid by **every** user of the product — including everyone who
never creates a repo — to serve a path the third reason shows was never universal anyway.

**3 · It was never universally possible.** The spike (MOTIR-1777,
`docs/github-repo-creation-mechanics.md` Mechanic 1) verified that `POST /user/repos` is
**user-access-token-only**: it is not available to installation access tokens. There is no
server-side, user-absent path to a personal-account repository at all — so the
what-the-user-HAS branch could only ever have worked while the user was present and
authorized, and never for the hosted agent acting later on their behalf. Creating in
**Motir's org** uses `POST /orgs/{org}/repos`, which the same table records as available
to an installation token.

**The credential split this makes explicit — three credentials, one consent.** They stay
separate on purpose:

| Credential                                                                   | What it is for                                                                                                | Permissions                                                               | Does a user consent to it?                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The provisioning credential** — scoped to **Motir's own org** (MOTIR-1779) | Creating and seeding every new project's repositories (`POST /orgs/{org}/repos`, template `generate`)         | `Administration: write` **on Motir's org only**                           | **No.** It is Motir's credential on Motir's org; it never appears in any user's install or authorize flow |
| **The user-facing Motir App** (MOTIR-890, shipped)                           | Everything the product already does with a user's repos — installation, indexing, dispatch, the webhooks      | **Unchanged.** MOTIR-890's least privilege; `Administration` is NOT added | Yes — the same grant they already give today, not widened by this decision                                |
| **The opt-in writer App** (MOTIR-1894 / MOTIR-1895, Epic 9)                  | Letting the **hosted agent push** to a repository the USER owns (after a 9.3.7 transfer, or a connected repo) | `Contents: write`, and only for users who opt in                          | **Yes — and it is the only NEW consent this decision ever asks for**                                      |

**A repo Motir owns is still the user's to reach.** Motir-owned is a hosting arrangement,
not a wall: the user gets access to their own code on the repository itself (MOTIR-1900
invites them as a collaborator on every repo Motir creates), independently of whether they
ever take ownership via 9.3.7. Ownership and access are separate questions, and this
decision only moves the first.

`Contents: write` is neither an organization permission nor the repository-administration
permission, so per the third-party-install quote above it does **not** trigger the
org-owner-only install restriction. That is precisely why the escalation is cheap where
`Administration` was not — and why the write capability is a separate, opt-in App rather
than a widening of the App everyone installs.

**One-way door — the two Apps stay separate.** Folding the opt-in writer's `Contents:
write` into the default App later cannot be undone without registering a **new** App
(permissions come off a registration only by re-consent of every installation, and the
narrowed-funnel effects of a wider default App are not recoverable retroactively). Keeping
them separate is the reversible choice, so it is the one taken.

**The Motir org is now load-bearing at scale, not a fallback — and that has two standing
consequences.** Every new project's repositories live there, so **(a)** their Actions
minutes and storage bill to Motir (metering and the plan gates are Epic 9's problem, not
this ADR's), and **(b)** Motir holds users' code by default, which is a trust and
Terms-of-Service surface the product copy must state plainly rather than let the user
discover. MOTIR-1778's design already carries the promise this obliges — _"It's yours —
move it to your own GitHub whenever you want."_

**What this asks of the not-yet-built cards** (recorded here so the sweep is visible, not
to re-scope them): MOTIR-1779 provisions the org and the provisioning credential and is now
on the critical path for **every** project rather than only the no-identity ones;
MOTIR-1781 creates against Motir's org via the installation token and does not implement a
user-account create path; MOTIR-1782 renders one default path plus the connect-existing
secondary, with no account picker for created rows; MOTIR-1900 grants the user collaborator
access to each created repo; MOTIR-711 (9.3.7) becomes the standard hand-off, not an edge
case. The planning defect this amendment corrects is logged as MOTIR-1897.

#### Amendment 2026-07-31 (Yue · MOTIR-1930) — the provisioning org's mirror is PER-WORKSPACE, and tenancy moves onto the repo row

**Why this exists.** The amendment above put **every** project's repositories in **one**
Motir org, behind **one** GitHub App installation. Nothing then re-examined the mirror that
assumption broke: `GithubInstallation` binds an installation to exactly ONE workspace, and
every tenancy read in the product resolves _installation → workspace_. This amendment
closes that consequence. It changes no decision in §3 — it records what §3 costs and what
the shape must therefore be. Surfaced by `motir run MOTIR-1781` (2026-07-31) under the
run-time claim gate: the creation primitive could not satisfy its own acceptance criterion
("associated with the project, and in the installation") because the shipped mirror cannot
represent one installation seen by more than one workspace.

**The decision, in three rulings:**

1. **Tenancy is a property of the REPOSITORY, not of the installation.** `github_repo`
   gains its own `workspace_id` and its own RLS predicate; `github_installation.workspace_id`
   becomes **nullable**, and `NULL` means _"Motir's shared provisioning installation, owned
   by no tenant"_. `installation_id` stays `@unique` — one installation is still one row.
2. **Every inbound delivery resolves its workspace through the REPO row.** The installation
   still selects which mirror rows a delivery may touch; the repo row says whose they are.
   `installation.workspaceId` is never again read to route, attribute, or authenticate.
3. **The shared installation never goes through `persistInstallation`.** `deleteExcept` is
   unreachable on the Motir-hosted path, by construction rather than by care.

##### The contradiction — verified at `motir-core` `origin/main` @ `a87d53f4`, not assumed

Six facts, each re-verifiable at the citation. They compound in order.

1. **One org, one installation, every tenant.** `.env.example:177-188` — `GITHUB_FALLBACK_ORG`
   is a single org login, and the "Motir Studio" App (`GITHUB_STUDIO_APP_ID` /
   `GITHUB_STUDIO_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`) is _"private (installable solely on the account that owns
   it)"_. Every workspace's created repos therefore sit behind **one** installation id.
2. **The mirror binds that installation to exactly ONE workspace.** `prisma/schema.prisma`,
   `model GithubInstallation`: `installationId String @unique`, with a single non-null
   `workspaceId`.
3. **And re-binds it on the next write.** `lib/repositories/githubInstallationRepository.ts:65-75`
   — `upsert({ where: { installationId }, update: rest })`, where `rest` **includes
   `workspaceId`**. The second workspace to establish a set silently moves Motir's
   provisioning installation to itself.
4. **Taking the first workspace's repos with it.** `githubInstallationService.persistInstallation`
   then calls `githubRepoRepository.deleteExcept` (`lib/repositories/githubRepoRepository.ts:164-173`)
   — every `GithubRepo` of that installation not in _this_ run's list is **deleted**.
   Workspace A's mirrored repos are pruned by workspace B's establish.
5. **A repo mirrored under another tenant's installation is INVISIBLE, so the row never reads
   as established.** `prisma/migrations/20260703120000_add_github_installation_repo_pr/migration.sql:120-140`
   — `github_repo`'s RLS policy joins through `github_installation.workspace_id`.
   `projectRepoRepository.listByProject`'s LEFT JOIN therefore returns the realized half as
   NULL (its own comment says so, `lib/repositories/projectRepoRepository.ts:41-43`), so
   `ProjectRepoDto.established` is `false` (`lib/mappers/projectRepoMappers.ts:53`) and
   `toProjectRepoNames` (`lib/projectRepos/names.ts`) drops the row — the repo is never
   dispatchable. That defeats the Story's own criterion, "an agent is told where to build".
6. **Every downstream consumer resolves installation → ONE workspace.**
   `githubWebhookService.ts:168 / 330 / 357 / 408` (push→index, CI status, reconcile, PR
   status sync), `ciMinutesMeterService.ts:146` (**which workspace gets billed**),
   `codeGraphIndexService.ts:72`. Unchanged, every created repo's PR, CI and index events
   route to whichever single workspace currently holds the row.

**Two further consequences the surfacing card did not name, found while verifying it.** Both
are load-bearing, and the second is the sharpest argument for the shape chosen below.

7. **A created repo is undispatchable for a SECOND, independent reason.**
   `githubRepoRepository.listByWorkspace` (`:41`) reads
   `where: { installation: { is: { workspaceId } } }` — the workspace's connected repo set,
   which is the validation domain and default source for `work_item.targetRepo`
   (`lib/workItems/targetRepo.ts:79`, MOTIR-1804). A repo created for workspace A joins
   through an installation bound to B, so it is absent from A's connected set even before
   fact 5's `established` path is reached. `findConnectedByWorkspaceAndName` (`:100`, the
   code-scanning proxy, MOTIR-1605) has the same join and the same hole.
8. **The keyless-OIDC trust seam authenticates a CI job into the WRONG TENANT.**
   `lib/github/oidcAuth.ts:102` — after `jwtVerify` validates the token, the tenant is
   `match.installation.workspaceId`. The repo is resolved globally by `(owner, name)`
   (`githubRepoRepository.findConnectedByName`, `:125`), and the guard against picking a
   tenant arbitrarily is _"reject when the coordinate matches more than one row"_. In one
   shared org a coordinate is globally unique, so **that guard can never fire for a hosted
   repo** — the read succeeds, returns one row, and reads the tenant off the shared
   installation. A verified OIDC token from workspace A's repo would authenticate as
   workspace B, acting as B's owner. This is the one consequence that is a cross-tenant
   **authentication** defect rather than a routing or visibility one.

**None of this is reachable today** only because nothing has ever created a repo in the
provisioning org. That is the whole window this amendment lands in.

##### 1 · The shape — `github_repo` carries its own `workspace_id` (option b)

**Decided: (b).** `github_repo` becomes workspace-scoped in its own right — a `workspace_id`
column with a direct RLS predicate — and the provisioning installation is held **once**,
with `github_installation.workspace_id` **nullable**.

**Why, in four points:**

- **Tenancy genuinely IS a property of the repo here.** Workspace A's repo and workspace B's
  repo differ by repository, not by installation — they share the installation by
  construction. A column on the row that actually varies is the honest model; a discriminator
  on the row that does not vary is not.
- **The schema already has this exact precedent, one table over.** `project_repository`
  carries its own `workspace_id` and gates on it directly — its migration comment says so
  in terms: _"the gate is the row's OWN `workspace_id`, not a join through"_
  (`prisma/migrations/20260730115208_add_project_repository_set/migration.sql:107-119`).
  Making `github_repo` match it removes an inconsistency rather than adding one.
- **Nullable `workspace_id` on the installation converts a silent mis-route into a compile
  error.** This is the decisive practical argument. Every one of the ten call sites in §2
  reads `installation.workspaceId` as a `string`; making it `string | null` makes TypeScript
  name each one. The sweep below is a checklist for the reviewer, but the compiler is what
  guarantees it is complete — no site can be missed by oversight.
- **`installation_id` stays `@unique`, so "an installation" keeps meaning an installation.**
  The token mint (`lib/github/appAuth.ts:104`, keyed on the host installation id), the GitLab
  `FOR UPDATE` refresh lock (`githubInstallationRepository.lockByInstallationId`) and the
  uninstall delete (`deleteByInstallationId`) all continue to address exactly one row.

**Rejected — (a) N `GithubInstallation` rows, one per workspace** (relax to
`@@unique([installationId, workspaceId])`). The cheapest diff, and it fixes visibility for
free: each workspace's repos hang off its own installation row, so the existing
`github_repo` / `github_pull_request` RLS joins keep working with **no policy rewrite**, and
`deleteExcept(installation.id, …)` scopes itself. **Its cost is that it buys none of the
sweep and damages the invariant.** `findByInstallationId` is a `findUnique` today; under (a)
it returns an arbitrary one of N, so all ten sites must change **anyway** — but silently,
with no type change to force them. Meanwhile `lockByInstallationId` would lock N rows (the
GitLab token-rotation guard degrades from a lock to a race), `deleteByInstallationId` would
delete every tenant's row on one uninstall, and the column comment _"UNIQUE (one row per
connection)"_ becomes false — the invariant survives only by convention on the paths where N
happens to be 1. Paying a real correctness cost for a sweep it does not shorten is the wrong
trade. (a) also does **not** settle question 3: `fetchInstallationRepos` returns the whole
shared org, so a per-workspace reconcile would still upsert every tenant's repos into one
row — a leak in place of a delete.

**Rejected — (c) Motir-hosted rows bypass the mirror** (`ProjectRepo` carries its own
realized `owner` / `name` / `defaultBranch` / host repo id). Conceptually the cleanest, and
the only shape that widens no tenancy-bearing index. **It breaks the PR→work-item loop.**
`GithubPullRequest.repoId` is a required FK to `GithubRepo.id` with `@@unique([repoId, number])`
(`prisma/schema.prisma`, `model GithubPullRequest`), and `GithubCheckRun` hangs off that. A
hosted repo would have no `GithubRepo` row, so the status sync — the mechanism that flips a
card to Done on merge, for **every** new project — would have nowhere to write, and would
need either a parallel PR table or a polymorphic FK. It also dissolves
`ProjectRepo.githubRepoId @unique` (the "at most one project claims a repo" guarantee that
`attachRealizedRepo` enforces, `lib/services/projectRepoSetService.ts:623`), the
`established` rule (`row.githubRepo !== null`), and `repoCloneUrl`'s coordinate source — then
adds a permanent second resolution path in the webhook, meter, code-graph and dispatch. The
largest consequence of the three, as the surfacing card anticipated, and larger than it
looked: the cost is not "a second routing path", it is the PR loop.

##### 2 · The resolution rule — the installation SELECTS, the repo row ATTRIBUTES

**The rule.** An inbound delivery carries `installation.id` (shared) and `repository.id`
(per-repo). Resolution keeps both hops and changes only which one answers _whose_:

```
installation_id (delivery)  → GithubInstallation   — WHICH mirror rows this delivery may touch
  + repository.id           → GithubRepo           — via @@unique([installationId, repoId])
                            → repo.workspace_id    — WHOSE it is        ← the only tenancy read
```

Keying on `(installationId, repoId)` — not on `repoId` alone — is deliberate. `repo_id` is
**not** globally unique: two tenants may legitimately connect the same public repository
under their own installations, and `findConnectedByName`'s existing ambiguity guard exists for
exactly that. The compound unique index already in the schema disambiguates without a new
read, so this rule needs **no new repository method** — only a change to which field the
workspace is taken from. The GitLab webhook path already resolves repo-first
(`gitlabWebhookService.ts:143 / 176 / 190` via `findByRepoIdAndProvider`); this brings the
GitHub path to the posture the newer provider already chose.

**The sweep — every call site that must adopt it.** All ten currently read
`installation.workspaceId`; each becomes a `null` at the type level under this amendment.

| Call site                                                           | What it resolves today                                                   | After                                                                                            |

| `githubWebhookService.ts:408` (`resolveGithubChangeRequestContext`) | PR status sync's tenant **and** `resolveBoundMember`'s membership lookup | `repo.workspaceId` (both)                                                                        |

| `githubRepoRepository.ts:41` (`listByWorkspace`)                    | the workspace's connected repo set → the `targetRepo` domain (`:79`)     | filter on the repo's own `workspace_id`                                                          |

The last row is in the list precisely because it does **not** change meaning: a nullable
column touches it, and a sweep that omits a site because it is correct is how the next
reader loses the guarantee that the list is complete.

##### 3 · Reconcile — the shared installation never reaches `persistInstallation`

**`deleteExcept` is NOT reachable on the Motir-hosted path.** Stated as a reachability
property, not a caution.

`persistInstallation` is correct for a user's own installation, where one reconcile sees that
workspace's whole selection: it fetches GitHub's authoritative repo set and prunes anything
absent. For the shared installation it is wrong twice over — `fetchInstallationRepos` returns
**every tenant's** repos, so a scoped reconcile would both delete the repos it did not fetch
and **leak** the ones it did into whichever workspace ran it.

So the shared path does not reconcile at all:

- **Creation writes one row.** MOTIR-1781 upserts exactly the `GithubRepo` it just created,
  stamped with the creating project's `workspace_id`, and calls `attachRealizedRepo`. It
  never calls `persistInstallation`, so no code path can reach `deleteExcept` with a
  provisioning-installation id.
- **The webhook skips it.** `reconcileInstallation` (`githubWebhookService.ts:357`) must
  return a typed **`skipped_shared_installation`** outcome — not `synced`, not `skipped_unbound`
  — for any delivery whose installation row has `workspace_id IS NULL`. A distinct outcome
  because the two mean different things operationally: unbound is "nobody connected this
  yet", shared is "this is ours and reconcile does not apply".
- **The null IS the guard.** A shared installation has no workspace to reconcile _for_, so
  the code cannot form the call: `persistInstallation` requires a `workspaceId: string`.
  There is no flag to forget to check.
- **Disconnect stays available and stays narrow.** `deleteByInstallationAndRepoId` (the
  single-repo delete) is unaffected — removing one hosted repo is still a legitimate,
  bounded write.

##### 4 · What the CI meter bills, and how the workspace is attributed

Cross-references `ci-minutes-allowance.md` §5.1–§5.2, which this amendment **narrows without
overturning**.

**The owner gate stands, as a QUALIFIER.** §5.1 meters a run iff its repository's owner login
is `GITHUB_FALLBACK_ORG` (`lib/ciMetering/config.ts:49`, read from the run's own payload per
§5.5). That remains exactly right: it answers _"does Motir pay for this run?"_, which is the
billing fact itself. §5.3 already recorded that the gate stops being selective once every
created repo is Motir-owned.

**What it can no longer do is attribute.** The owner login is now true for every tenant's
repos, so it qualifies a run for metering and identifies **nobody** to charge. Attribution
comes from the repo row: `repo.workspaceId` → `ProjectRepo` (via `githubRepoId @unique`) →
project → workspace → organization. §5.2's documented chain is unchanged — it always ran
through `ProjectRepo`; what changes is the workspace the chain is _entered_ under.

**The concrete failure this prevents, and its direction.** `ciMinutesMeterService.ts:146`
binds `withWorkspaceServiceContext(installation.workspaceId)` and reads `project_repository`
under it. That table's RLS gates purely on `app.workspace_id` with no system escape, so a
hosted repo read under the wrong tenant's GUC resolves **no** project row, and the run lands
in §5.4's _"metered as a cost, charged to nobody, and LOGGED"_ bucket. The defect therefore
degrades to **systematic under-billing**, not cross-tenant over-billing: Motir would pay for
every project's CI and invoice no one, loudly, in the log. Worth stating plainly — RLS holds
the safety line even while routing is wrong, which is why this is a correctness bug found in
a design review rather than an incident. The service's own comment claims cross-tenant
mis-attribution is "structurally impossible"; that claim survives this amendment intact, and
it is what converts the bug into silence rather than harm.

**No change to what a run costs, to §3's normalization, or to the pool.** Only which
workspace the chain starts in.

##### 5 · What this asks of the not-yet-built cards

Recorded so the sweep is visible; **no card below is re-scoped by this amendment.**

The schema change, the RLS policy rewrite and the ten-site sweep are **MOTIR-1931**'s, in
one PR — they are one contract, and landing the nullable column without the sweep is the
window in which the mis-routing is live. This amendment ships **no schema or app change**.

MOTIR-1781 (the creation primitive) is unblocked: it can now write a mirror row that its own
project can see, and its "in the installation" criterion becomes satisfiable. Through it,
**MOTIR-1782** (the approval-step UI reads `established` off a row that is finally true),
**MOTIR-1900** (collaborator invites, which act per created repo), **MOTIR-1913** (role →
`targetRepo` resolution, which reads `toProjectRepoNames` — fact 5 — and the workspace's
connected set — fact 7) and **MOTIR-711** (the take-it-over transfer, which must move a
repo's tenancy with it) all depend on this shape and none of them changes because of it.

The planning defect this amendment corrects — the ownership reversal moved every tenant's
repos behind one installation without re-checking the mirror — is logged as **MOTIR-1932**.
It is the second instance of a recorded class: _a card's preconditions include the
ENTITY/KEY it hangs on, not only the data-source mechanism it reads_ (`notes.html`, the
motir-ai org-identity finding). There the key was absent across a service boundary; here it
was present but no longer identifying. Both are the same check, missed the same way.

#### Amendment 2026-07-31 (Yue · MOTIR-1943) — TEAM access: who else gets into the code, at what permission, and where the door is

**The gap this closes.**
[§3's ownership amendment](#amendment-2026-07-30-yue--motir-1893--a-new-projects-repos-are-always-motir-owned)
made every created repository Motir-owned and **private** — and closed the hole it opened
for exactly one person, in its own words: _"the user gets access to their own code on the
repository itself (MOTIR-1900 invites them as a collaborator on every repo Motir
creates)"_. **The user. Everyone else on the team was left out.** On the six-person
workspace Motir dogfoods, five members cannot clone their own project's code by any path. `design/repository-set/design-notes.md` §5 records the gap and
defers it deliberately; MOTIR-1910 carries the mechanism. This amendment decides the five
questions that mechanism cannot decide for itself, because each is an access-control or
spend question rather than an implementation one.

**Evidence pinned at:** `motir-core` `origin/main` @ `ed929fe6` (includes MOTIR-1900).
Every answer below names the decision-authority rung it came from and where its evidence
lives — verified against that tree, not carried over from the card that asked the question.

##### Q1 · WHICH members are invited — the ones the product already lets EDIT the project

**The invitable set is exactly the members for whom the shipped project-access policy
`canEdit` returns true**, enumerated with the same access-level scoping
`assignableMembersService.list` already applies. Motir does not invent a second membership
rule for code; it reuses the one the product enforces everywhere else.

Concretely: enumerate candidates the way the assignable-members chokepoint does — a
`private` project scopes to its `ProjectMembership` rows, every other level to the
workspace's members — then keep each candidate for whom
`canEdit({ accessLevel, workspaceRole, projectRole })` is true.

**Rung 2** — `lib/projects/access.ts` (the pure policy: `canEdit`, its two rails and the
per-level table), `lib/services/assignableMembersService.ts` (the shipped,
access-level-scoped enumeration chokepoint), `prisma/schema.prisma` (`MemberRole`,
`ProjectAccessLevel`, `ProjectMembership`, `WorkspaceMembership`).

**Why NOT "every `ProjectMembership` whose role is not `viewer`"** — the option MOTIR-1943
was authored recommending, and the reason the answer moved: it is **under-inclusive**. Two
shipped facts break it. On an `open` (or `public`) project **any workspace member edits
with no `ProjectMembership` row at all**, and a workspace **owner/admin passes both rails
regardless of project membership** (`isWorkspaceManager`). A membership-row query would
therefore lock out precisely the people who can already change everything in the project —
its owner included. `canEdit` is the product's own answer to "who changes this project's
things", so it is the answer here.

**What reusing the policy excludes for free** — which is the argument for reusing it rather
than restating it: a project `viewer` is read-only everywhere and is never invited; a
non-workspace-member never passes the null-deny rail; and the **`public` access level does
not widen the grant** — an external or signed-out viewer of a public project is denied
`canEdit` by that same rail, so making a project public exposes its issues for reading and
never its code. (`public` is a fourth `ProjectAccessLevel` value that postdates the
question as it was framed; it is recorded here so no implementer has to re-derive it.)

##### Q2 · WHAT permission — `push` per invitee, with `admin` reserved to the owner

**A teammate is invited at `push`; the approving user keeps `admin`.** The permission is
therefore **per-invitee data**, not one value for the whole product.

**Rung 2** — `lib/github/repoCollaborators.ts` pins `COLLABORATOR_PERMISSION = 'admin'` as
a module constant and justifies it in-comment by the takeover path: the repository is the
user's _"in every sense but the account it sits under… including the settings needed to
take it over later (MOTIR-711)"_. That reasoning is **owner-shaped**. MOTIR-711 transfers
the whole set out of Motir's org and only the owner walks it; a teammate needs to clone,
branch and push — not to transfer, rename or delete the project's repositories. **Rung 1** —
GitHub's own repository roles separate `write` from `admin` for exactly this split.

**⚠️ The retrofit this obliges, called out for the implementer.** `COLLABORATOR_PERMISSION`
is a module constant and `repoCollaboratorClient.invite()` sends it unconditionally, so the
permission must become a **column on the new per-`(repository × user)` record** and a
parameter of the invite call. MOTIR-1910 owns that change — it rides the same cardinality
retrofit that turns `project_repository`'s four singular `collaborator_*` columns into a
per-member table — and its **backfill must stamp the owner's existing row `admin`**, so no
access already granted is silently downgraded by the migration that generalises it.

##### Q3 · WHO sees the connect prompt — each member, only for their OWN identity

**A member is offered _Connect GitHub_ only for themselves.** Someone looking at a teammate
who has no connected identity sees a **reason**, never an action they cannot take — and **a
GitHub handle is never typed in**.

**Rung 2** — `GithubIdentity` is `@unique` on `userId` and holds that user's own OAuth token
(`prisma/schema.prisma`); `projectRepoAccessService.grantAccess` resolves the identity of
the **acting** user and returns `login: null` as the connect-prompt signal. Motir cannot
OAuth on a teammate's behalf, so an uninvitable member is a state to explain, not a form to
fill. A typed handle is refused for the reason MOTIR-1900's own comment gives: it proves
nothing, and a typo invites a **stranger** to a private repository.

##### Q4 · WHERE the surface lives — project settings, at _Access & members_

**Team code access is rendered in PROJECT SETTINGS, on or beside the _Access & members_
pane** — where a person already goes to ask who on this project can do what. Whether it is a
section within that pane or a sibling pane is MOTIR-1944's to draw; what is decided here is
the surface itself, against the two candidates below.

**Rung 2** — the peer surface is SHIPPED, not hypothetical:
`app/(authed)/settings/project/members/page.tsx` (+ its `ProjectMembersSettings`), with the
design assets `design/projects/access-members.mock.html` and
`design/projects/settings-area.mock.html`. `ProjectRepo` is project-scoped, so a
project-settings home matches the data's own scope.

**The two rejected placements.** The **code-context surface** (MOTIR-1764) is about index
freshness and the code-blind planning state — repositories as an input to planning, not
people. The **plan-approval repo-set step** is ruled out by its own design:
`design/repository-set/design-notes.md` §5, _"a teammate is not standing at plan approval,
so their door belongs on a surface they actually reach."_

This question was escalated to a decision rather than left to the designer on purpose — an
undecided placement is an architecture choice, and the design-against-shipped-reality rule
routes exactly that case here. MOTIR-1944 draws the surface **and its access path** against
this answer.

##### Q5 · The CI-spend blast radius — NO new guard, recorded so that none is built

**Widening push access adds no new enforcement surface. The two shipped guards already
cover it, for two different reasons — an implementer should build neither a per-member CI
cap nor a second refusal path.** This was checked against both services rather than assumed
— MOTIR-1943 flagged it as the answer most worth falsifying, on the grounds that if it did
not hold, the guard it discovered would be this decision's most valuable output.

**Rung 2:**

- **The pool GROWS with the people added to it.** `lib/ciMetering/allowance.ts` sets
  `INCLUDED_MINUTES_PER_SEAT = 300` under an `ORG_POOL_FLOOR_MINUTES = 1000` floor, and
  `ciAllowanceService` recomputes `pool = max(members × 300, 1000)` **from org membership at
  read time** — never accrued, never from Stripe's lagging seat quantity. A teammate who can
  push is a seat that already enlarged the allowance.
- **The two membership sets cannot diverge in the direction that would matter.** Org
  membership **gates** workspace access (`OrganizationMembership`, in-schema: _"a workspace
  is reachable only by a member of its org"_), so every member Q1 makes invitable is
  necessarily counted in the pool that funds them.
- **The guard that actually covers a teammate's push is MOTIR-1907's, and it is
  count-independent.** `ciAllowanceService` states its own limit in-code: it owns _"the
  DISPATCH-side refusal ONLY"_ and cannot by itself stop GitHub billing Motir, because _"a
  push, a fix-up commit, the admin-collaborator grant (MOTIR-1900) and repo-resident
  triggers all reach Actions with no claim."_ The enforcement that does reach them
  **disables Actions on the repository** at `ci_credits_exhausted`, derived per ORG and
  fanned out per repo (`ciActionsGateSweep`) — so it holds identically for one pusher or
  twenty.

**The honest residual, named rather than guarded.** N pushers drain a shared pool faster, so
an org reaches `ci_credits_exhausted` sooner. That is a **metering** outcome, not an
access-control one, and the existing two-threshold model (draw credits, then refuse) is what
answers it. **The revisit trigger, so this stays falsifiable:** measured consumption showing
teams routinely exhausted by teammate pushes rather than by dispatches — the same kind of
datum `docs/decisions/ci-minutes-allowance.md` §1.4 already names for re-pricing the pool.

##### What this asks of the not-yet-built cards

Recorded so the sweep is visible. **The sweep was run and no card below needed re-wording:**
each already defers its answer to this decision instead of restating one, which is exactly
what kept a stale answer from being baked in while the question was open.

- **MOTIR-1910** (the mechanism) — eligibility resolves through `canEdit` + the
  assignable-members scoping (Q1), never a raw membership query; the permission becomes a
  per-invitee column defaulting to `push`, with the owner's backfilled row at `admin` (Q2);
  a member with no `GithubIdentity` is recorded as not-invited-with-a-reason (Q3). It adds
  **no** CI guard (Q5).
- **MOTIR-1944** (the design) draws the surface in project settings at _Access & members_,
  with its access path (Q4). Its **not eligible** state has two distinct reasons to draw —
  _the role does not grant edit_ (Q1) and _no connected GitHub account_ (Q3) — and they are
  different rows with different forward paths: the first is settled, the second is
  actionable by that member and by nobody else.
- **MOTIR-1945** (the surface) renders against MOTIR-1944 and consumes MOTIR-1910's DTO.

**Nothing in §0–§2 or §4–§6 changes, and no earlier §3 text is superseded** — this
amendment answers a question §3 left open rather than reversing anything it decided.

The planning defect that made this decision necessary — MOTIR-1910 named its own missing
decision in its body and was authored `ready` regardless — is logged as **MOTIR-1946**.

### §4 — Rows are INDEPENDENT, failure is honest, and the step is resumable

**4.1 · The per-row lifecycle:**

```
proposed ──create──▶ creating ──▶ created
   │                    │
   │                    └──error──▶ failed ──retry──▶ creating
   │                                   │
   ├──connect-existing──▶ connected ◀──┘
   │                                   │
   └──skip──▶ skipped ◀────────────────┘
```

`created`, `connected` and `skipped` are settled states. **`failed` is resumable, not
terminal**: a failed row can be retried, switched to connect-existing, or skipped, at any
later visit to the step.

**4.2 · One row's failure does nothing to the others, and nothing is rolled back.** A
created repository is a real artifact in the user's own account. Deleting it to preserve
an all-or-nothing illusion would mean Motir destroying something the user can already see,
on an error path, to make a report look tidier — strictly worse than reporting the truth.
So there is no compensating delete, no transaction spanning repo creation, and no
all-or-nothing gate. Per the side-effects-outside-tx rule, repo creation is a network side
effect outside any database transaction anyway.

**4.3 · Approval MAY complete with a row unresolved — yes, deliberately.** A skipped or
failed row leaves the project **explicitly code-less for that role**, which is a state the
product already models and renders (the BYOK code-index loop, MOTIR-1754). Blocking
approval on a GitHub failure would hold the user's whole plan hostage to an org policy or
a rate limit.

**4.4 · The per-row state lives on the project, which is what makes the step
re-enterable.** Approval is not the last chance to establish a repo; the set is a durable
property of the project, editable and completable afterwards.

### §5 — The PLANNER pins, by ROLE; MATERIALIZE resolves it to a repo and validates it

This is the consequence that the one-repo premise hid. `resolveDispatchTargetRepo` falls
back to _the workspace's **single** connected repo_, and returns `null` at two or more,
deliberately refusing to guess. **The fallback that carries a one-repo project cannot carry
a two-repo one.** So a multi-repo plan must pin each item — and the Story's acceptance
criterion "an agent is told where to build" is unsatisfiable otherwise.

**5.1 · The planner pins, at generation.** It is the only participant that knows which
layer a card belongs to — it already writes a repo tag per card in prose, under a rule that
says _"name the OWNING REPO of each file the card will create or modify."_ Neither the
materializer nor the user can recover that from a title. The alternatives are worse: a
**materializer** guess is the arbitrary choice the shipped resolver already refuses to
make; asking the **user** to pin every item is a form for something the planner just
decided.

**5.2 · What is pinned is the ROLE, not the repo name — and this is the load-bearing
detail.** At generation the repositories **do not exist**: the set is derived from the tree
(§0.1) and the user may rename any row before it is created. A name pinned at generation is
stale the moment the user edits a row, and meaningless before the row is created at all. A
**role** is stable across both. So:

```
generate ──▶ each proposal carries a repo ROLE
   └──▶ materialize RECORDS it on the item (work_item.targetRepoRole)
          └──▶ the distinct roles ARE the proposed set (§0.1)
                 └──▶ user edits + confirms the set, a row is ESTABLISHED (§4)
                        └──▶ establishing that row RESOLVES the role ──▶ its repo NAME
                               └──▶ work_item.targetRepo (the shipped bare-name column)
```

This closes the ordering hazard cleanly — the tree can be generated before any repository
exists, which is the actual sequence — and it leaves the shipped `targetRepo` contract
untouched: the column still holds a bare repo NAME, still validated against the connected
set by `resolveAuthoredTargetRepo`.

**5.3 · Resolution VALIDATES, never guesses — and it runs when a ROW BECOMES ESTABLISHED,
not at materialize.** Resolution has exactly three outcomes, and only the first writes a
pin:

- **exactly one** row carries the role AND it is established → `targetRepo` is that row's
  repo name;
- **exactly one** row carries the role but it names no repository that exists yet — still
  `proposed` / `creating`, or `skipped` / `failed`, or its mirror is gone → `targetRepo`
  stays `null`. The item is honestly unrouted, which is the same signal the shipped
  resolver already emits, and the code-index loop already renders;
- **more than one** row carries the role (a repeated role, §1.2) → the proposal must name
  the row, not just the role; an ambiguous pin resolves to `null` rather than to an
  arbitrary row. Guessing here would send an agent into the wrong checkout, which
  `docs/decisions/target-repo-attribution.md` §3 established is strictly worse than no
  answer. **Ambiguity is counted over ALL rows carrying the role, in ANY state** — not
  only the established ones. Counting only established rows would both guess (half the
  items belong in the row that was skipped) and make the answer depend on RUN ORDER, since
  this pass runs per row as each is established. Counting rows makes the verdict a property
  of the SET, identical no matter which row establishes first, or how many times the pass
  runs.

**WHEN this is evaluated — corrected 2026-07-31 (MOTIR-1914) against shipped ordering.**
This section first placed the resolution "at materialize". Verified on `motir-core`
`origin/main`, materialize is the one moment it cannot happen:

- `plansService.approvePlan` materializes the tree INSIDE the approve `$transaction`, and
  fires `projectRepoProposalService.proposeRepositorySet` only **after that transaction
  commits**, best-effort — the pre-plan read is a `server-only` client call that cannot run
  inside a tx. So on the onboarding path the project's repo set **does not exist yet** when
  its items are created.
- And once it does exist, its rows are `proposed`. `ESTABLISHED_PROJECT_REPO_STATES` is
  `['created', 'connected']` (`lib/projectRepos/vocabulary.ts`) — states a row reaches only
  through the creation primitive (MOTIR-1781) or the establish UI (MOTIR-1782), i.e. after
  the user confirms the set (§0.2, §4).

Resolving at materialize would therefore write `null` for every role, every time — outcome
two above, on the happy path. So the pin is a TWO-STEP: the ROLE is recorded on the work
item at materialize (MOTIR-1912), and RESOLVED to a name when a row becomes established
(MOTIR-1913 — `projectRepoPinService.resolvePins`, invoked from
`projectRepoSetService.attachRealizedRepo` after that method's own locked transaction
commits, so every establish path reaches it whether the row was created or connected). The
three outcomes above are unchanged; only **when** they are evaluated moved, because this
ADR was written before the approve-time ordering shipped. The shipped code is the arbiter
and the ADR follows it (rung 2), not the other way round.

Two properties fall out of evaluating later, and are worth stating because §4 depends on
them: the pass is **idempotent and re-runnable** — a row established later (a retried
failure, §4.4) resolves the items still carrying its role, and a re-run pins nothing new;
and a role whose row is never established leaves its items unrouted by **waiting**, rather
than by writing `null` eagerly at materialize and calling that an answer.

**5.4 · Once a set is established, a proposal MAY carry the resolved repo NAME directly.**
For a re-plan, an augment, or an `expand_item` on a project whose repos already exist, the
names are final and there is no ordering problem — so the pin may be the name, validated
the same way `create_work_item` / `update_work_item` already validate an authored
`targetRepo`. **Role is the portable pin; name is the settled one.** Materialize accepts
either — a NAME is validated and written straight through at approve; a ROLE is recorded
and resolved later, per §5.3.

**5.5 · What this asks of the cards that build the seam**, so no leg is left unowned. The
role pin is a THREE-card seam, not two — emit, carry, resolve — because §5.3's correction
splits recording the role from resolving it:

| Leg         | Repo         | Card       | What it owns                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emit**    | `motir-ai`   | MOTIR-1885 | The tree generator pins each proposed leaf to a repo **ROLE** (§5.2), from the role enum §1.1 fixes.                                                                               |
| **Carry**   | `motir-core` | MOTIR-1912 | `targetRepoRole` on `PlanItemProposedFields` / `PlanItemPatch` → `work_item.targetRepoRole` at materialize; the distinct roles FEED the set derivation as §0.1.1's primary signal. |
| **Resolve** | `motir-core` | MOTIR-1913 | §5.3's three outcomes, evaluated when a row becomes established — role → the row's repo NAME → `work_item.targetRepo`.                                                             |

A fourth card, **MOTIR-1884** (`motir-core`), shipped the §5.4 leg: a proposal carrying an
already-settled repo **NAME**, validated at approve against the project's set. It is
correct for the settled-set case and is deliberately left in place — it is not the role
carrier, and the two pins coexist.

Every card here is `blocked_by` this ADR, and this section is the specification they build
to — the load-bearing part being §5.2: what a proposal pins on a FRESH project is a
**role**, never a repo name. (The first pass of this section named only two cards and
described both as carrying the name; MOTIR-1914 records why that was wrong and corrects
it. A card citing this ADR must read §5.2 to the clause, not to the section.)

### §6 — The single-repo project is the degenerate case, not a second code path

One architecture, one model, one decision:

- **§0** proposes **one row**, role `web` — the thin-signal default.
- **§1.4** names it `<project-slug>`, with **no role suffix**, so nothing about it reads
  like "one of several".
- **§1.3** makes it the primary row by construction.
- **§2** seeds it from the default starter — the ordinary path.
- **§5** resolves every item's role to that one row, so every item is pinned to it.
- **§4** applies unchanged: one row that can fail, be skipped, or be connected to an
  existing repo — which, chosen for a project's only row, is exactly how a **monorepo**
  collapses the set to one.

The one-question feel is a property of the **presentation** of a one-row set (MOTIR-1778 /
MOTIR-1782), never of a second branch in the model.

## Consequences

- **MOTIR-1780's table is a SET table**, per row: role, free-form label, name, seed source,
  establish state, and the project-level ownership + target account. Ordered, primary
  first. It is also the **project↔repo association** whose absence
  `codeGraphIndexService.ts:30-31` records as an unbuilt refinement — this ADR does not
  ask that card to fix the indexing fan-out, only to make the association exist.
- **MOTIR-1881 must read across the open/closed boundary.** The class / platform /
  starter signals live in **motir-ai** and reach core only via
  `aiPreplanService.getPreplanState` (`GET /v1/preplan`), which returns `session: null` for
  any project that never ran a pre-plan — a migrated project, a seeded one. The derivation
  must degrade through §0.1's ladder to the one-web-repo default rather than fail.
- **`PlanItemProposedFields` grows a repo field** (MOTIR-1884) — the first field it carries
  that materialize must resolve against _project_ state rather than map straight onto the
  created row. Adding a field to a read-back DTO breaks exact-shape route tests; expect the
  sweep.
- **motir-ai's proposal schema grows a role field** (MOTIR-1885). Its enum must stay in
  lockstep with §1.1 — the same cross-repo constant discipline `AI_DRAFT_EXPLANATION_SOURCE`
  already follows.
- **The ROLE pin is carried and resolved in two separate steps** (MOTIR-1912 + MOTIR-1913),
  for the ordering reason §5.3 records: `work_item` grows `targetRepoRole` alongside
  `targetRepo`, and the role→name write happens on row establishment. So establishing a
  repository gains a follow-on DB pass, and an item can sit with a role and no name for as
  long as its row is unestablished — the honest unrouted state, not a missing write.
- **`resolveDispatchTargetRepo`'s single-connected-repo fallback stays**, as the
  compatibility path for every project that predates the set (including this one). Once a
  project has an established set, MOTIR-1783 resolves against the **project's** set instead
  of "the workspace's single repo"; the fallback is what answers for a project that has
  none. _(2026-08-19 amendment, MOTIR-3086: "for a project that has none" is no longer the
  whole condition — the fallback is ALSO layered under the set, set first, for a project that
  arrived WITH CODE of its own, whose repositories the set is structurally unable to name. See
  the MOTIR-3086 amendment below.)_
- **Ownership is a set-level property**, so 9.3.7's transfer flow gets a project-scoped
  query and a whole-set transfer, not a per-repo hunt. §3.5 is what guarantees the set is
  transferable as a unit. _(2026-07-30 amendment: every created set is Motir-owned, so
  9.3.7 is on the **standard** path — the transfer flow is what makes the default
  honest, not a rarely-taken branch.)_
- **A `type: manual` prerequisite is confirmed, not created here:** §3.3 requires a Motir
  fallback org to exist. MOTIR-1779 already owns provisioning it, alongside whatever grant
  change MOTIR-1777 determines. _(2026-07-30 amendment: no longer a fallback — MOTIR-1779
  is a hard prerequisite for **every** project that establishes a repo set, and what it
  provisions is the org plus a provisioning credential holding `Administration: write` on
  **Motir's own org**. The grant change MOTIR-1777 was expected to determine for the
  user-facing App is **not** taken: that App keeps MOTIR-890's least privilege.)_
- **Nothing here re-decides the GitHub App model** (7.10, shipped) and nothing re-scopes the
  coding convention from project to repo (a 7.14 change). §1's per-row role is deliberately
  compatible with a per-repo convention landing later.
- **The connected-repo mirror becomes a TENANCY-BEARING table** _(2026-07-31 amendment)_.
  `github_repo` carries its own `workspace_id` and its own RLS predicate;
  `github_installation.workspace_id` is nullable, and null means the shared provisioning
  installation. Every installation→workspace read in the product moves to the repo row (the
  ten-site sweep), and the shared installation never reconciles. This is the first place a
  GitHub row's tenant is not derivable from its installation, and it is a property of §3's
  one-org decision rather than of the repo set itself. MOTIR-1931 lands it; MOTIR-1932 logs
  the planning defect.
- **Collaborator access becomes a per-`(repository × user)` RECORD, and the permission a
  column on it** _(2026-07-31 team-access amendment)_. MOTIR-1900 modelled access as four
  singular `project_repository.collaborator_*` columns — one collaborator per repository —
  so inviting the team is a cardinality retrofit, not a loop over the shipped shape. The
  permission moves off the `COLLABORATOR_PERMISSION` module constant onto that record
  (`push` for members, `admin` backfilled for the owner). MOTIR-1910 lands it, MOTIR-1944
  designs the surface, MOTIR-1945 renders it; MOTIR-1946 logs the planning defect. **Repo
  access now MIRRORS the product's own `canEdit` policy** rather than defining a second
  membership rule — so any future change to project access levels or roles reaches the code
  grant automatically, and is a place to re-check this amendment.

## AMENDMENT (2026-08-19, MOTIR-3073) — the proposer asks whether the project HAS CODE, not whether its set is empty

`proposeRepositorySet`'s original gate was _"does this project's repository set have any
row?"_, and §4.3's idempotence argument is why: a set with rows must never be touched. That
argument is unchanged and still correct. What it does not cover is the project that arrives
**with a codebase already** — because such a project has no rows either, and the two states
are indistinguishable to that gate.

The **migrate** onboarding path records its repository as `connected_repo_ref` on the
onboarding run and never writes this table. So every migrated project read as never-proposed
forever, and its first plan approval proposed a starter repo, showed the establish step in
place of the approved plan's items, and — because a project's set IS its repo-pin domain
(`dispatchRepo.ts`'s scope ladder) — made every repository the project actually uses
unpinnable. Observed on Motir's own project; the row is retired by MOTIR-3078.

**The gate is now two questions, in this order:**

1. `set_exists` — unchanged, first, and still the access-gated one.
2. `project_has_code` — the project's onboarding run names a connected repository.

**The signal is PROJECT-scoped, and deliberately only the onboarding run.** `GithubRepo` and
the code-graph index ledger are keyed on the WORKSPACE (`projectStateService.resolveCodeState`
says so in its own header), so gating on _"the installation has repos"_ or _"something is
indexed"_ would silence the proposer for every project after the first in any workspace that
has ever connected code — and the second project in a workspace genuinely does need a
repository. It is keyed on the FIELD rather than on `kind === 'migrate'`, so any future
onboarding path that connects an existing repository is covered the day it ships.

### A project that has code AND a set with an unsettled row

This state is now reachable only DELIBERATELY — the proposer will not create it, so a row on
such a project was put there by a person or by an earlier plan (multi-repo is a legitimate
shape: having code does not mean having _all_ the code a plan needs). Nothing changes for it:
`set_exists` answers first, the set is left alone, and the establish step continues to render
for the unsettled row exactly as it does today. **The step is not dropped and needs no new
door** — MOTIR-1764's permanent entry point already leads back to it. What the amendment
removes is only the case where Motir invented the row itself and then demanded a decision
about it.

## AMENDMENT (2026-08-19, MOTIR-3086) — the workspace rung is layered UNDER the set for a project that arrived WITH CODE

The amendment above stopped Motir from **proposing** a repository to a project that already
has code. This one is about the **deliberate** path it does not touch: a user who genuinely
wants Motir to host a new repository alongside the ones they already have, via the establish
step's `＋ Add repository`. Today that request costs them the repositories they came with.

**The mechanism.** `dispatchRepo.ts`'s scope ladder chose between two registries on
`getRepoNameDomains`'s `hasSet: rows.length > 0`, so the very FIRST row a project ever gained
switched its repo domain — pin AND dispatch — from "the workspace's connected repositories" to
"exactly this set". For a project born in Motir that is right and invisible. For a project
that ARRIVED with code it is the whole defect, because such a project has **zero rows by
construction**: the establish step's _"I already have code"_ branch sends the user to the
GitHub **connect** flow, which is a WORKSPACE-level installation connection and writes no
`project_repository` row at all (`GithubRepo` is keyed on `workspace_id` and has no
`project_id`). The first hosted repository therefore did not join a list — **it became the
list**, because until that moment no list existed as data. Observed on Motir's own project:
five repositories connected and indexed, one row added, and from that moment `motir-core`
could not be pinned on any card through the MCP, the UI, or a plan.

### The decision

**The workspace rung is layered UNDER the set — set first — exactly when the project has code
the set cannot describe.** The signal is the one the MOTIR-3073 amendment already argued for
and shipped: the project's onboarding run names a connected repository. It is now a shared
predicate (`lib/projectRepos/ownCode.ts`) that both the proposer's gate and the resolver's
ladder call, so the two cannot come to disagree about which projects arrived with code.

Order is meaningful and the SET goes first: a repository the project planned outranks one it
inherited from the installation, and a repository named by both is answered by its set row.

### This CONTRADICTS `dispatchRepo.ts`'s recorded reasoning, and here is the argument against it

The resolver's header stated, and the "Consequences" bullet above assumed:

> It is a fallback for a MISSING set, never a second guess layered under a real one: a project
> that HAS planned its repositories is answered by that plan alone, even when the plan resolves
> to nothing.

That sentence is **narrowed, not withdrawn**, and it remains exactly right for the project it
was written about. Its argument is sound — a project that has planned its repositories should
be answered by that plan, and layering a second guess under a real plan would hand back a
repository the project deliberately did not choose, including the sibling project's repository
that workspace-wide validation used to accept.

**What it did not survive is the two-registry finding.** The sentence rests on a premise it
does not state: that the set is a complete statement of a project's repositories. That premise
is _unavailable_ to a project whose repositories arrived through the connect branch — not
merely unmet, but structurally impossible, because nothing on that branch can record them.
For such a project the set is a statement about the repositories Motir was asked to **plan**,
and answering _"which repositories does this project have?"_ by it alone answers a different
question. A rule that is sound wherever its premise holds and wrong wherever the premise
cannot hold is a rule with a missing condition, which is what this amendment supplies.

Two consequences of that reading are worth stating rather than discovering:

- **The fallback did nothing wrong.** It stepped aside exactly as its author intended, and the
  outcome was still wrong. The defect is in the predicate that told it to.
- **The union is CONDITIONED, not unconditional.** A project with no code of its own is
  answered by its set alone, byte-identically to before — which is why the shipped
  repository-set journey needed no edit, and why `§3`'s sibling-project isolation is untouched
  for every project it was written for.

### What follows from it

- **A project with code and a set of ≥1 row now has an AMBIGUOUS domain, and stops guessing a
  single default.** `resolveDispatchRepo`'s "exactly one repo" rule is unchanged; the domain
  is simply larger, so an unpinned card resolves to `null` rather than routing into whichever
  repository was added last. That is the other half of the reported defect, not a regression:
  such a project genuinely HAS several repositories and there is no non-arbitrary choice.
- **A pin that resolves through the workspace rung is stored as a NAME, not a reference.** The
  union adds no `project_repository` row, so there is nothing for such a pin to point at, and
  a partial reference list would leave `refs[0]` naming a different repository than `names[0]`
  — the primary every dispatch surface routes on. `resolveAuthoredRepoPinsInProject` therefore
  emits references all-or-nothing and otherwise falls to `work-item-repository-set.md` §A7's
  compatibility rung, which is where that project's pins already were before its first row.
- **`hasSet` is no longer a switch.** It still records that the project has planned
  repositories, and that is still what makes the set answer FIRST. Whether anything is layered
  under it is a second question, asked where the ladder lives.

### What this does NOT fix — the deeper reading, deliberately not taken here

**A project still has no real record of its own repositories.** `GithubRepo` has no
`project_id`, so _"this project's repositories"_ is not expressible as data until the set
table is populated, and this amendment answers the question with a union of two registries
rather than with one honest record. The stronger fix — the connect branch recording a
`connected` row per repository the project actually uses — was considered and is **not** done
here, for a reason worth recording rather than re-deriving:

**neither seeding nor recording can recover what was never told to Motir.** Only the
onboarding run's `connectedRepoRef` is project-scoped, and it names ONE repository. A faithful
seed of Motir's own project produces one row and loses the other four — the exact repositories
the defect was reported about. That a project uses `motir-gateway` is not recorded anywhere,
in any registry, so making the set complete for an EXISTING project requires **asking the
user**, which is a new surface and a migration, not a fix for this defect. The union is what
makes the product correct with the data that exists; recording the association is what would
let this rung eventually retire, and it is the thing to build next if a project's repository
record is wanted for its own sake.

## AMENDMENT (2026-09-06, MOTIR-4669) — a repository belongs to the ORGANISATION, and the uniqueness contract that said otherwise is FALSE, not relaxed

Two things are recorded here: the guarantee that replaced §1's implicit one, and the tenancy
decision the whole story turns on. Neither section above is deleted or rewritten — §1.4, §1.5 and
§4.4 stand exactly as they were, and this amendment says which of their consequences no longer
holds and why.

### A · The uniqueness contract

`ProjectRepo.githubRepoId` was `@unique`, and `prisma/schema.prisma` stated the consequence in
prose:

> _"a realized repo is claimed by AT MOST ONE project row, so a repo created for project A can
> never be recorded as project B's."_

**That sentence is FALSE now, and the distinction from "relaxed" is the point.** Until MOTIR-4648
dropped the index, the situation it forbids was **inexpressible**: a single unique constraint made
it impossible to create, which is why nothing downstream ever had to answer what it would mean.
Relaxing a rule leaves the old behaviour available; this removes a claim the product was making.

**What SURVIVES is narrower and is still enforced by the DATABASE, not by application code:**

```
@@unique([projectId, githubRepoId])   // one repository, at most once, in ONE project's set
```

- It is what the shipped **409** on a double-add now means: _already in THIS project_, never
  _claimed by somebody_.
- Postgres treats NULLs as distinct in a unique index, which is exactly right here — every
  `proposed` row is unrealized, and a project may hold many.
- **Removing a concept is allowed; removing a capability is not.** Four shipped call sites asked
  the old index _"which project owns this repository?"_ — `ciMinutesMeterService`,
  `ciRunnerProvisioningService`, `projectRepoSetService`'s claim guard and
  `pullRequestLinkCheckService`. MOTIR-4648 gave each an answer that still works, and split the
  read in two so the difference is forced at the call site:
  `findByProjectAndGithubRepoId` (the CLAIM guard, scoped to one project) and
  `listByGithubRepoId` (the SET, so a caller has to decide what TWO means). The old total read
  `findByGithubRepoId` is **gone**, and a test asserts it stayed gone — it would type-check and
  return a plausible row.

### B · The tenancy: connected ONCE, to the organisation

> A repository is connected **once, to the ORGANISATION**. Which projects use it is **visibility
> configuration**.

This is **MOTIR-2029**'s decision for the code GRAPH, applied to the thing the graph is built FROM.
**Cited, not restated:** that record owns the graph's half, and the two must not be left to be
inferred from each other.

⚠️ **MOTIR-2029's decision lives on the WORK ITEM, not in `docs/decisions/`** — verified: no file
here references it, and `code-graph-index-fleet.md` (§14, the offboarding vocabulary) does not carry
the fan-out question. So this amendment cites a card rather than a document, deliberately: a link to
a record that does not exist reads as a citation and checks as nothing.

**The four tenants, and what each owns.** The question is always _whose thing is this?_

| tenant      | surface                           | who                                            | owns                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ORG**     | Settings → Organisation → Git     | org admin                                      | the host connection's lifecycle, and the whole repository inventory with each row's `Used by N projects` |
| **PROJECT** | Settings → Project → Repositories | room: `repository:manage` · **add: org admin** | which of the organisation's repositories this project works on                                           |
| **PROJECT** | the `Code` rail row               | browse                                         | READ only                                                                                                |
| **USER**    | Settings → Account → Git accounts | any member                                     | your own `GithubIdentity` — `userId @unique`, a personal credential                                      |

**⚠️ Adding is ORG ADMIN whichever door you enter by.** The Repositories room asserts
`repository:manage`, a PROJECT permission, so without an explicit org check a project admin who is
not an org admin could connect a repository to the organisation through it. The assertion lives in
the SERVICE (`organizationRepoService`), inside the transaction — a gate on a button is a gate one
caller away from being missing.

**⚠️ READING the inventory is org MEMBERSHIP, not org admin**, and the asymmetry is required rather
than generous. `docs/decisions/organization-tier.md` §6 forbids a relocation that narrows an
audience — _"a hidden tier may not remove a capability … relocating a surface preserves its
gate"_ — and the surface this inventory moved from, `/settings/workspace/github`, checks a session
and a workspace context and **no role at all**. Its consequence: `Used by N projects` must read the
**access-filtered** project set, and the count must be that list's length. A count of four beside
two names is the same disclosure arriving as a number.

### C · The two removals are asymmetric, and each names its own tier

|                | **Remove from this project**          | **Disconnect from organisation**                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| what changes   | one `ProjectRepo` row                 | every project's link, across the organisation's workspaces                        |
| the code graph | **nothing**                           | offboarded — `repo_disconnected`, **windowed** `CODE_GRAPH_RETENTION_WINDOW_DAYS` |
| reversible     | re-add any time; the graph never left | re-add inside the window and nothing re-indexes                                   |
| who            | `repository:manage`                   | org admin                                                                         |

**⚠️ The org-level disconnect CLEARS the links; it does not delete the rows.**
`ProjectRepo.githubRepo` is `onDelete: SetNull` and says why on itself — a project's PLAN for a
repository outlives its connection to one, so the role, name and seed source survive and the row
can be re-established. Deleting the rows would delete the projects' plans as a side effect of an
integration change.

**⚠️ Awareness is a COLUMN, not a sentence.** `Used by N projects` renders on every inventory row
AT REST, expandable to the names. A warning inside a dialog is read past; a count that was on screen
all along is not, and the dialog naming _Atlas, Beacon_ is then a confirmation rather than a
revelation. ONE read serves both, so the row and the dialog cannot disagree.

**⚠️ And the org dialog is NOT a permanence warning.** The window is user-facing, the reason is
windowed, and the shipped copy already promises that re-adding cancels the removal. A screen saying
_"this cannot be undone"_ would be FALSE — and false in the direction that teaches people to click
through warnings. Every user-facing string INTERPOLATES the constant; the number is never retyped
(`lib/codeGraph/offboarding.ts` states that rule on itself).

### D · Two rules that stop the obvious wrong optimisations

These are **rules**, not notes. Both describe changes a reasonable implementer would make for
tidiness, and both would re-introduce per-project ownership through the back door.

1. **A project-level remove enqueues NO offboarding.** It deletes one `ProjectRepo` row and nothing
   else — no new member on `CodeGraphOffboardReason`, no queue write of any kind. The absence is
   asserted on the enqueue seam's call count, because a remove that quietly offboarded would return
   200 and look correct, and the damage would surface days later as a repository nobody can plan
   against.
2. **Zero projects using a repository is a LEGAL state.** It belongs to the organisation, stays in
   the inventory and stays indexed. _"Nothing uses it any more, so drop the graph"_ would make the
   next project that adds it pay for a full re-index — the exact cost this tenancy move removes.

### E · The GitHub asymmetry — the disclosure precedes the link-out

**Motir cannot remove a GitHub repository.** Which repositories the App may read is GitHub's own
install screen, and the shipped copy already says so (`github.repos.foot`). So the two providers get
two different affordances, and the difference is drawn rather than smoothed:

|                 | **GitHub**                                           | **GitLab**                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| who performs it | github.com                                           | Motir, in-app                       |
| shape           | a **disclosure**, then a link-out                    | an ordinary destructive **confirm** |
| when            | **before** leaving, because there is no later moment | at the moment of the act            |

A Motir-side "stop tracking" for GitHub is **forbidden**: it would delete the mirror row while
leaving the App's grant in place, and the repository would reappear on the next installation
reconcile — two sources of truth for one fact. The removal arrives through the
`installation_repositories` delivery, which already prunes the row and enqueues the windowed
offboarding.

### F · Why the dedup boundary is the ORGANISATION and not the repository

Two organisations connecting the same repository index it **twice**, and that is correct.

The organisation is the **isolation boundary** — the tenancy every RLS policy, every credit ledger
and every access gate is written on. A graph shared across organisations would be a cross-tenant
read of derived content, reachable by whoever connected the repository second; the saving is real
and it is not a saving the product may take. Inside one organisation the dedup is total, which is
where the cost actually lives: N projects of one customer, one index.

### What this amendment does NOT decide

- **The code graph's own tenancy** — **MOTIR-4642** keys the graph to the organisation. This story
  moves the repository; that one moves the graph, and this record deliberately stops at the
  boundary rather than pre-empting it.
- **Index FRESHNESS** — whether a graph is current or stale is MOTIR-1754/1766's axis. Neither the
  indexed commit nor the comparison lives in motir-core today.
- **`repoSetOwnership`** (§3) is untouched: it answers _who hosts the repository_, which is a
  different question from _who is it connected at_, and the two are independent.

## Deferred to the spike — asserted nowhere in this document

MOTIR-1777 verifies four GitHub mechanics, and **no decision above depends on their
outcome**: (a) whether creating a repo needs a scope beyond the identity grant — which the
schema documents as granting _no_ repo access; (b) whether an all-repositories installation
covers repos created afterwards; (c) whether a repo can be added to an existing
installation by API rather than by sending the user to GitHub's settings; (d) what creating
N repos back-to-back costs, and whether a partial failure is retryable per repo. §1.5's
collision _mechanism_ and §4.1's retry _ergonomics_ are the two places this ADR
deliberately stops short and points at (d).
