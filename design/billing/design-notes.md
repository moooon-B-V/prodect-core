# Billing · pricing · paywall — design notes

Design reference for the **`billing`** UI area — the **commercial surfaces** that
gate Motir's two billed products. Story 8.1 (Stripe billing + open-core tiering),
subtask **8.1.3** (card **MOTIR-1142**). The asset is the source of truth for the
two motir-core UI code subtasks, both `blocked` behind this design gate
(Principle #13 + the design-reference rule; `notes.html` #31):

| Code subtask                                                         | What it builds from this asset                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **8.1.7 / MOTIR-1148** — billing settings panel + plan/pricing UI    | Panels **1–6, 8** (settings panel, states, storefront, seats subscription, empty/error) |
| **8.1.8 / MOTIR-1149** — paywall / upgrade prompt at the AI boundary | Panel **7** (out_of_credits 402 + tier-gate + member variant)                           |

These two cards are linked to MOTIR-1142 as `relates_to` (with the boundary
service **8.1.6 / MOTIR-1147**) — they SPECIFY the flow this design draws; the
design GROUNDS in them and does not invent it. Built FROM the real design system
(`app/globals.css` `--el-*` colour tokens + the `[data-display-style]` shape
tokens + the shipped `components/ui/*` primitives), so the code subtasks compose
the same primitives — no design→code gap.

> **Refined by 8.1.15 / MOTIR-1302 (2026-06-23)** against the SHIPPED storefront
> (`app/(authed)/settings/organization/billing/_components/BillingClient.tsx`, built
> by 8.1.7 / MOTIR-1148) — three changes, each grounded in that component +
> `billing-tiering.md`, NOT invented:
>
> 1. **Seat upgrade screen (panel 6a, shipped `SeatsView`) gains a Monthly/Annual
>    `Segmented`.** `SeatsView` hardcoded annual (`checkout(seat.annual…)`, all-annual
>    terms); the catalog already carries `seatPlan.prices.monthly` (`$5`) +
>    `.annual` (`$40`), so the toggle re-prices the seat total, terms & CTA exactly
>    like the AI storefront's `PlansView`.
> 2. **The on-page cloud-only note (shipped `CloudNote`) is dropped.** The page is
>    `notFound()` off-cloud (`isCloudBilling()`), so it ONLY renders on cloud — the
>    banner is redundant. Self-host behaviour stays documented here in prose (the
>    "Self-host" section below), never as an on-page banner.
> 3. **The Motir AI pricing blocks (panel 5, shipped `PlanCard`) are redesigned**
>    from short cards (name + price + one credits line) to the standard SaaS tier
>    pattern (Linear / Vercel / Stripe): tall, equal-height cards in ONE row, each
>    with a per-tier use-case line + a cumulative "Everything in {previous}, plus …"
>    feature list.
>
> Code follow-ups blocked on this asset: **8.1.16 / MOTIR-1303** (seat toggle +
> drop the note) and **8.1.17 / MOTIR-1304** (pricing blocks).

## What this area is

The **org owner's home for money** — the surface that SELLS where the sibling
**`ai-usage`** dashboard only SHOWS. The two compose side by side in the
org-settings area and must not duplicate: **`ai-usage` = spend / balance / drill
/ run log; `billing` = plan / subscription / payment / checkout / paywall.** The
billing panel cross-links to Usage & cost (panel 2) rather than re-drawing the
balance dashboard.

### The locked model this draws (read at run time — do NOT invent)

Everything here is grounded in **`docs/decisions/billing-tiering.md`** (8.1.1 /
MOTIR-1138, **Accepted 2026-06-21**). The load-bearing facts:

> **Terminology (Yue, 2026-06-21): there is no "Tracker" customer-facing.** The
> two products' user-facing names are **"Motir"** (the PM tool — the seat plan)
> and **"Motir AI"** (the credit plan). "Tracker" survives ONLY as code
> identifiers — the `scaled-tracker` motir-core org flag and the
> `tracker_monthly` / `tracker_annual` Stripe price lookup keys — never as a UI
> label. This asset labels its two lines "Motir" and "Motir AI".

- **TWO billed products** (decision §1), largely independent with **ONE bundle: a
  paid AI plan includes 1 Motir seat** (8.1.22 / MOTIR-1316). Your bill = ① + ②:
  - **① Motir** (the PM tool) — **free** for any team within the caps,
    **$5 / seat / mo** ($40 / seat / yr — the annual default, ~33% off) only when
    the org crosses a cap. The scaled state is a **motir-core org subscription
    flag**, NOT the AI tier.
  - **② Motir AI** (planning + agents) — an **org-level monthly credit plan**, prices
    firm from the Stripe sandbox catalog (8.1.2 / MOTIR-1141; `starter` removed
    by the 2026-06-23 amendment, 8.1.18 / MOTIR-1308): **Free** (300
    credits, one-time trial, $0) /
    **Standard** ($25/mo · $200/yr, 2,000/mo) / **Pro** ($75/mo · $600/yr,
    8,000/mo — the **recommended anchor**, `pro_pool_annual` is the Stripe default
    Price) / **Max** ($150/mo · $1,200/yr, 30,000/mo) / **Enterprise** (custom).
    This is the motir-ai `PlanTier`. Any org — free- or scaled-Motir — can buy it.
    **Each PAID plan includes 1 Motir seat → the org's §4 caps are lifted** (the
    solo plan-with-AI case is never walled at 250 items; members beyond the first
    bill at $5/seat). The Free trial does NOT include a seat. Overage **credit
    top-up is $10 / 1,000** (one-time at Checkout).
- **Free-tier caps** (decision §4, drawn in the Motir line, panel 2): **≤ 250
  work items** (archived + active), **≤ 3 projects**, **1 workspace**, **10 MB /
  file**, **2 GB total**, **unlimited members**.
- **Subscription lifecycle** (decision §5) → the status `Pill`:
  `trialing` / `active` / `past_due` / `canceled`. `past_due` keeps access
  through the grace window with a warning banner; `canceled` drops to the free
  allotment, **data retained, never deleted**.
- **Credits are an internal ALLOTMENT, never a currency in-product.** The balance
  / allotment is labelled "credits" everywhere. The ONLY place a currency (`$`)
  appears is the **plan FEE** the org pays Stripe — the pricing storefront
  (panel 5) and the AI-plan fee line (panel 2). That is a price, not a credit
  count.
- **Permissions** (decision §7): billing **mutations are owner-only**; an **admin
  views** (read-only); a **member** is routed to an owner.
- **402 at the AI boundary.** motir-ai raises `out_of_credits` → **HTTP 402**
  (`OutOfCreditsError`, `src/problem.ts:16`), surfaced over the 7.1 boundary. The
  paywall (panel 7) handles it.

### Where it lives + the access path (panel 1)

- The billing surface lives in the **org-settings area**
  (`app/(authed)/settings/organization/…`), **org owner/admin gated** (a member
  gets the panel-4b routed-to-owner state, not a 404). It **REPLACES the passive
  `BillingPlaceholderCard`** (`_components/BillingPlaceholderCard.tsx`, the
  "Billing & usage — Coming soon" card) with the live surface.
- **Access path — drawn, not just named (mistake #31).** The shell TopNav **org
  menu** (the 6.10 org-admin menu holding Settings / Members / Usage & cost)
  carries a **"Billing & plans"** item — the row the `ai-usage` design left as a
  passive "Coming soon" now goes **active**. Selecting it opens the billing area;
  the settings stack shows the live **Billing card** (the door) where the
  placeholder used to sit. Panel 1 draws the TopNav, the open org menu with
  **"Billing & plans"** as the active row (`--el-tint-lavender`, the
  credit-card icon), and the destination settings stack — composing the shipped
  `Popover` + menu `opt` grammar, not a new control. Given the surface's size,
  8.1.7 MAY promote it to a dedicated `settings/organization/billing` route
  (sibling of `usage/`) — either way the access door is the org-menu row + the
  settings entry.
- **Data over the 7.1 boundary.** Subscription/tier figures are fetched
  client-side over the motir-core ↔ motir-ai boundary (the 8.1.6 billing service
  → 8.1.5 motir-ai endpoints): the loading skeleton (panel 8b) and the
  fetch-failed error (panel 8c) are real states. Numbers in the mock are
  illustrative.

### Self-host — these surfaces are CLOUD-ONLY

Billing **and** the §4 caps exist **only on cloud**, behind the **`MOTIR_CLOUD`**
flag (decision §6). On a self-hosted (GPL-3.0) build **none of these surfaces
render** — no Billing card, no paywall, no caps; Motir is unbounded and AI
is reached via the self-hoster's own connection. 8.1.7/8.1.8 MUST gate every
surface here behind `MOTIR_CLOUD` (a note states this on panel 7). This flag is
**distinct from** `isAiPlanningConfigured` (which gates whether AI is reachable).

> **No on-page "Cloud-only" banner (8.1.15 / MOTIR-1302).** Because the billing
> page already `notFound()`s off-cloud (`isCloudBilling()`), it ONLY ever renders
> on cloud — so a per-page "Cloud-only" banner (the old `CloudNote`) told the
> on-cloud reader something that is always true and never reaches the self-host
> reader at all. It is dropped from every panel. **This section is the canonical
> record of the self-host behaviour** — do not re-add an on-page banner.

---

## Panels (review EACH — mistake #31)

### Panel 1 — access path (the entry point)

The TopNav org menu OPEN with **"Billing & plans"** as the active row, and the
org-settings stack below with the live **Billing card** replacing the passive
placeholder. The card carries a one-line summary (`Motir · Free`, `Motir AI ·
Standard`, an `Active` status `Pill`) and an **Open** affordance. The door is
drawn; the room is panels 2–7.

### Panel 2 — billing settings panel (owner, populated & active — the PRIMARY view)

A `stack` of `Card`s under the `Organization · {org} · Billing & plans`
breadcrumb. The two billed lines + payment:

- **① Motir line (`Card`).** Head: a mint product glyph (`i-layers`), title
  **"Motir"**, a state `Pill` (**"Free"** neutral / **"Scaled"** when paid).
  Body on `free`: a one-line explainer, then a **caps grid** of three cells —
  **Work items** `182 / 250`, **Projects** `2 / 3`, **Storage** `0.4 / 2 GB` —
  each with a token-only `.meter`. Then a **seat preview** (`.seatcalc`): the
  member avatars + **"Scaling bills 1 seat per member — 6 today"** and the
  resolved total **"6 × $5 = $30 / mo"**, so the per-seat price is concrete before
  the user ever clicks. Action: **"Upgrade Motir"** + a **"Seats follow membership
  · prorated automatically"** caption. (On a `scaled` org the caps grid is replaced
  by the billed seat count + renewal and the action is "Manage seats" — panel 6b.)
- **② Motir AI line (`Card`).** Head: a lavender product glyph (`i-sparkle`),
  title **"Motir AI"**, the subscription status `Pill` (**Active**). Body: a tier
  `Pill` (**"Standard"**) + the subscription amount **"2,000 credits / mo"** +
  — **when the org holds purchased top-ups — an `--el-tint-sky` `pill-topup`
  beside it: `+3,000 top-up`** (the EXTRA credits, distinct from the recurring
  allotment) + the **plan fee "$25 / mo"** (right-aligned). Then the **allotment
  meter** with **"1,420 of 2,000 left"**, and a second `meterlbl` totalling the
  two pools: **"+3,000 top-up credits (extra · don't expire)"** | **"4,420 credits
  available"**. The `desc` notes **"monthly allotment resets; purchased top-up
  credits roll over"**. (No top-up held → the `pill-topup` + the total line are
  omitted; the meter reads the allotment alone.) Actions:
  **"Change plan"** (primary → panel 5), **"Manage plan & payment"** (secondary,
  `i-external` → Stripe Customer Portal), and the **"View Usage & cost"**
  cross-link (`i-coins`, to the `ai-usage` dashboard).
- **Payment & invoices (`Card`).** A payment-method row (card brand chip + `••••
4242` + expiry + an Update affordance) and a **"Stripe Customer Portal"**
  button (`i-external`) — the Portal owns invoices, VAT ID, payment-method change
  and cancellation. A dashed `note` states tax is applied automatically.

### Panel 3 — panel states (the non-happy subscription lifecycle, decision §5)

- **(a) `past_due` / dunning.** The status `Pill` is **"Past due"** (`pill-pastdue`);
  a **`--el-tint-yellow` warning banner** ("We couldn't charge your card… stays
  active while we retry over ~2 weeks") with an **"Update payment"** primary
  action; the allotment meter fills in `--el-warning`. Access is KEPT through
  grace.
- **(b) `trialing` / Free (one-time grant).** Status `Pill` **"Free trial"**
  (`pill-trial`, sky); the one-time **"185 of 300 credits left"** meter; copy
  that the grant doesn't refresh; a **"Choose an AI plan"** primary.
- **(c) `canceled` → free.** Status `Pill` **"Canceled"** (`pill-canceled`, rose);
  a **`--el-tint-rose` banner** stating the plan ended, the org is back on the
  free allotment, and **nothing was deleted** (plans / work items / history
  intact); a **"Resubscribe"** primary.

### Panel 4 — role gating (decision §7)

Two mini-surfaces side by side so the gate is visible:

- **(a) Org admin — view-only.** The same AI-plan card with a **"View only"**
  `Pill` (`i-eye`), the allotment meter, and **no** Change-plan / Portal buttons;
  a lock `note` explaining changing the plan / payment / cancelling is
  **owner-only**.
- **(b) Org member — no billing access.** An `EmptyState`-style gate (`i-lock`,
  `--el-tint-lavender` icon) — **"Billing is managed by your org owner"** — with
  a **"Contact an owner"** secondary, never a dead billing control.

### Panel 5 — Motir AI — plans & subscription (a SEPARATE, AI-ONLY screen)

> **Why its own screen (Yue, 2026-06-22).** The two products are **independent**
> (ADR §1 — "neither gates the other"), so the AI plan gets its **own screen**, not
> a shared "choose your plans" page bundling seats. A user who **already pays for
> seats** should not wade through the seat plan to change AI — and vice-versa. So:
> **Motir AI lives here (panel 5); Motir seats live on their own screen (panel 6);
> neither screen shows the other product.** The billing home (panel 2) is the hub
> with one line per product, each routing to its own screen: the Motir-AI line's
> **"Change plan"** → here; the Motir line's **"Upgrade Motir"** → panel 6.

Reached from the Motir-AI line's "Change plan" (panel 2) and the paywall (panel 7),
under the `… · Motir AI` breadcrumb. The screen is **pricing AND subscription**:

- **Current-subscription strip (`.curbar`).** At the top: the active AI plan — a
  **"Standard"** tier `Pill` + **"Active"** status `Pill` + "2,000 credits / mo ·
  1,420 left · renews 1 Jul 2026" + a **"Manage plan & payment"** (→ Portal)
  button. So a returning subscriber sees their state first, then the ladder to
  change it. (Omitted / replaced by a "no AI plan yet" line for a free-AI org.)
- **Monthly / Annual cadence toggle (the SaaS-standard pricing control).** A
  `Segmented` ("Monthly" | "Annual") sits **below the headline, above the cards** —
  the single highest-impact control on a pricing page. **Annual is the default**
  (the Stripe annual default; defaulting to annual lifts annual adoption ~25–35%)
  with a **"Save ~33%"** `seg-badge`; **Monthly is always available** (hiding it
  erodes trust). It re-prices the ladder (`setCadence()` flips
  `.store[data-cadence]`; CSS shows `.cad-a` / `.cad-m`). The pattern follows the
  verified SaaS convention (mirror below):

- **Annual selected (default):** each paid card shows the **per-month equivalent**
  (`$50 / mo`, not the yearly lump) with a `billed annually · $600 / yr` subline
  and a green **`Save $300/yr`** `save` pill — **dollar** savings, which beat a
  bare "%". (Per-month-equivalent + dollar-savings are the two display rules the
  mirror sources converge on.)
- **Monthly selected:** the card shows the monthly fee (`$75 / mo`) with a
  `$900 / yr · Save $300 with annual` nudge back toward annual.
- The `$0` Free cards and the **Enterprise** (Custom) card are cadence-inert.

The PNG captures the **Annual** default. 8.1.7 wires the toggle to the two
annual/monthly Stripe Prices (`*_annual` is the Product's default Price).

The cards (AI ladder only — the Motir seat plan is panel 6, never shown here):

- **The Motir AI ladder — the standard SaaS pricing-tier pattern** (rung 1 —
  Linear / Vercel / Stripe). **Five** `plan` cards — the **Free** trial + the four
  named paid tiers **Standard / Pro / Max / Enterprise** (`starter` removed by the
  2026-06-23 amendment, 8.1.18 / MOTIR-1311) — that are **TALL, equal-height, and laid
  out in ONE row** (the `.ai-grid` is a `display:flex` row, `align-items:stretch`
  equalising height so the CTAs sit on a common baseline; `flex:1 0 0` +
  `min-width:158px` per card; five cards fill the row more generously than the prior
  six). **Responsive rule (drawn):** below the row's natural
  width the container **scrolls horizontally** (`overflow-x:auto`, scroll-snap) —
  the five cards stay one comparable ladder, never wrapping to a second row or
  dropping tiers. Each card, top → bottom:
  1. **Tier name** (+ `i-zap` / `i-crown` accent glyph for Pro / Max, + the
     "Current" / "Recommended" `Pill`).
  2. **A per-tier USE-CASE line (`.use`, who it's for)** — the new top-of-card
     line, secondary colour, ~3-line `min-height` so the price rows align across
     cards. The ladder is **planning DEPTH then agent USAGE**: planning depth tops
     out at Standard (whole project, in detail); Pro and Max only scale agent work.
     **Free** "Trying Motir AI out." / **Standard** "Detailed planning, plus a taste
     of agent." / **Pro** "Detailed planning, plus real agent work." / **Max**
     "Detailed planning, plus heavy agent work." / **Enterprise** "Custom volume,
     plus org controls."
  3. **The cadence-aware price** (serif `.amt`) + the billed/save subline.
  4. **The credit allotment** (`.alot`, the load-bearing figure, bold) — the credit
     COUNT lives here, so the feature bullets stay capability-focused (no count
     duplication).
     4b. **The bundled Motir seat** (`.seat`, `i-users` glyph; 8.1.22 / MOTIR-1316) —
     every PAID plan includes 1 Motir seat, so the line reads **"+ 1 Motir seat ·
     work items uncapped"** (Standard / Pro / Max) — the value point that the AI plan
     lifts the §4 work-item caps for the solo case. **Enterprise** → "Motir seats
     included (custom)". **Free** uses the `.off` variant (`--el-text-faint`) — **"No
     Motir seat · 250-item cap"** — stating the absence so the contrast is the
     upgrade reason. Sits directly under `.alot`.
  5. **A CUMULATIVE `i-check` feature list** — the cumulative chain starts at the
     first PAID tier (**Standard**, now the entry rung), so each tier from Pro up
     opens with a flush-left `.flead` caption **"Everything in {previous tier}, plus"**
     (no glyph), then its incremental extras. The deltas map to the depth→usage ladder:
     **Standard** (base of the paid ladder, NO "Everything in" — Free is just a
     trial, not the rung below) → "Plan the whole project, in detail" · "Credits
     refresh monthly · metered top-ups" · "Room to try agent tasks"; **Pro**
     (everything in Standard, plus) → "Run the coding agent on real tasks" · "Top up
     anytime for heavier runs"; **Max** (everything in Pro, plus) → "Headroom for
     sustained agent work" · "Throughput for a busy team"; **Enterprise** (everything in
     Max, plus) → "Invoiced billing & SSO" · "Dedicated support". **Free** is a
     standalone trial (no "Everything in"): "A one-time taste of every agent" + an
     `off` (`i-x`, faint) "No monthly refresh · no top-ups".
  6. **A per-tier CTA → Checkout** (pinned to the bottom via `margin-top:auto`).

  Tiers: **Free** (`$0` once · 300 credits · one-time, "Trial used") / **Standard**
  (`$25` → `$16.67/mo`
  · $200/yr · save $100 · 2,000, marked **Current** — the entry paid tier) / **Pro** (`$75` → `$50/mo` ·
  $600/yr · save $300 · 8,000, `i-zap` accent, marked **Recommended** — the anchor
  tier) / **Max** (`$150` → `$100/mo` · $1,200/yr · save $600 · 30,000, `i-crown`
  accent) / **Enterprise** (Custom). The current plan is accent-bordered + disabled
  CTA; the recommended Pro card is accent-bordered (`feat rec`) with a "Recommended"
  `Pill`. A footer `note` states annual-is-shown / switch-to-monthly,
  tax-at-checkout, credits-vs-price, an **expectation-setter that agent / coding
  work burns more credits than planning and heavier models burn faster (top up

**Credit top-up (the one-time overage purchase — `creditService.topUp()`).** Below
the ladder, a **"Top up credits"** `Card`: the recurring plan covers the monthly
allotment, top-ups are the **pay-as-you-go overage** beyond it (ADR §2/§3,
`credit_topup` Stripe Price, `mode: 'payment'` one-time). It shows the current
**balance** + allotment-used line, a row of **bundle** options
(**1,000 · $10 / 5,000 · $50 / 10,000 · $100 / Custom × 1,000**, one selected with
the accent border), a **"Buy {n} credits — ${total}"** CTA, and the rate line
(**"$10 per 1,000 credits · one-time · tax at checkout"** — a price the org pays
Stripe, distinct from the in-product credit allotment). A `note` gates it:
**top-ups need a paid AI plan — the Free trial can't top up** (matching the §2
table: Free has no top-ups), **owner-only** (§7). The paywall's "Buy credit
top-up" (panel 7a) routes here. (`$` is legitimate here — it's a purchase price,
not the credit allotment, which is never shown as currency.)

### Panel 6 — Motir (seats) plan & upgrade screen (the seat-only counterpart to panel 5)

This is the **Motir seat plan's own screen** — the parallel to the AI screen
(panel 5), kept separate for the same reason: it shows seats only, never the AI
plan. Reached from the Motir line's "Upgrade Motir" (panel 2). Seat = member,
billed per-seat:

Motir Scaled is billed **one seat per organization member** — the seat item's
Stripe `quantity` syncs to membership (ADR §3). So the design **shows the seat
count wherever the seat price appears**, never an abstract "$5/seat" alone. Two
sub-surfaces:

- **(a) BEFORE — upgrade review (before Checkout).** A width-constrained `Card`
  (a confirmation dialog) titled **"Scale up Motir"**. **A Monthly/Annual
  `Segmented` cadence toggle sits at the top of the body** (8.1.15 — the seat screen
  hardcoded annual before; this is the same control the AI storefront uses, labelled
  "Billing", **Annual default** with a "Save ~33%" `seg-badge`, **Monthly always
  available**). It re-prices everything below it (`setCadence()` flips
  `.store[data-cadence]`; the cadence-tagged `.cad-a` / `.cad-m` spans show/hide —
  the catalog carries `seatPlan.prices.monthly` `$5` + `.annual` `$40`). Then a
  `.seatcalc` (member **avatars** + **"6 members → 6 seats"** + the cadence-aware
  total — **"6 × $40/yr = $240 / yr"** annual / **"6 × $5/mo = $30 / mo"** monthly),
  then a **`.terms` key/value list that spells out what & when we charge** — the part
  a narrow note couldn't carry:
  - **Billing** — _annual:_ Annual, $240/yr ($20/mo equiv, the default), with a green
    **"Saves $120/yr vs monthly"** `save` badge; _monthly:_ Monthly, $30/mo ($360/yr
    — switch to annual to save $120).
  - **Due today** — _annual:_ $240, **prorated** to the renewal date (less for the
    days left this term); _monthly:_ $30, **prorated** to the renewal date.
  - **Add a member later** — a **prorated charge** for the new seat, for the rest of
    the term.
  - **Remove a member** — a **prorated credit** on the next invoice — **no mid-term
    refund**.

  Then a short `note` (seats follow membership automatically via Stripe proration;
  pick Monthly/Annual above before continuing — the old "switch at Checkout" line is
  obsolete now the toggle is in-page) and the **cadence-aware CTA** (**"Continue to
  Checkout — $240/yr"** annual / **"— $30/mo"** monthly) + Cancel. (Implementation
  note: a `.note` is `display:flex`; its text MUST be wrapped in ONE `<span>` — bare
  text + inline `<b>` become separate flex items and shred into narrow columns. The
  cadence variants use bare `.cad-a` / `.cad-m` hooks — the visibility rule keys on
  those classes, not on `.cad`, so they stay plain inline spans, no `.price`
  inline-flex.)

- **(b) AFTER — the live Motir seats subscription (full-width).** The **scaled
  counterpart to panel 2's free-Motir line** — same `Card` grammar as the Motir-AI
  line, so the paid Motir plan reads as a real subscription, not a fragment. Head:
  the `i-layers` glyph, **"Motir"** / "scaled seats subscription", an **"Active"**
  status `Pill`. Body: a `.row1` with a **"Scaled"** tier `Pill` + **"6 seats"** +
  the right-aligned **"Plan fee $240 / yr"** + an **"Annual · saves $120/yr"**
  `save` pill; a `.seatcalc` (avatars + **"6 seats billed · 1 per member"** + **"6 ×
  $40/yr = $240 / yr"**); a `desc` — **"Billed annually · $20/mo equiv · renews 1
  Jul 2026. All free-tier caps lifted … seats track membership: adding a member adds
  a prorated charge for the rest of the term; removing one applies a prorated credit
  to the next invoice (no mid-term refund)."**; actions **"Manage seats"** (`i-users`),
  **"Manage plan & payment"** (→ Portal), and a **"Switch to monthly billing"**
  cross-link. (This is the surface the user lands on after subscribing; panel 2
  shows the same org's Motir-AI line + the _free_ Motir line. The plan defaults to
  the **annual** rate — the Stripe annual default the storefront also defaults to.)

> **Mirror (rung 1 — cited).** Showing the billed seat count at upgrade is how

>
> **Mid-cycle changes on an ANNUAL seats plan — what & when (the panel-6 copy).**
> Both mirrors agree, and Motir (Stripe proration, ADR §5) follows them:
>
> - **Add a member mid-term → a prorated CHARGE for the new seat covering the rest
>   of the annual term**, at the annual per-seat rate. _Linear_ generates a
>   prorated charge for the remaining year, reconciled on a **monthly true-up**
>   invoice tied to the annual start date (charged automatically); _Jira_ charges
>   the added seat prorated through the remainder of the annual term. (Motir =
>   Stripe `create_prorations`; surface it as "a prorated charge for the rest of the
>   term".)
> - **Remove a member → a prorated CREDIT applied to future invoices, NOT a cash
>   refund; the annual total does not drop mid-term.** _Linear_ issues a credit on
>   suspension applied to future invoices; _Jira_ defers the reduction to the next
>   billing cycle. (Motir mirrors this: credit-to-next-invoice, no mid-term refund.)

> **Implementation owner (do NOT build it here).** The mechanism behind this
> proration — keeping the Stripe seat `quantity` in sync with org membership on
> invite/remove — is **8.1.12 / MOTIR-1256** (a motir-ai `seat-quantity` endpoint
>
> - a motir-core membership-change hook, behind `MOTIR_CLOUD`, surfaced as a
>   planning gap on 2026-06-22). It is NOT in 8.1.7/8.1.8: those render these states
>   (the panel-6 subscription card + the invite-time seat note); the seat-quantity
>   write itself is 8.1.12. Inviting a member **does not** pop a Checkout/pay-wall —
>   the seat count updates and Stripe accrues the prorated delta to the **next
>   invoice** (auto-charged on the card on file; a monthly true-up for annual).

### Panel 7 — paywall at the AI boundary (8.1.8)

The in-product upsell. **This ACTIVATES the passive "out of credits" slot the
`ai-usage` design drew** (its panel 7b `.passive-slot`, shipped as
`OrgUsageClient` `OutOfCreditsCard`) — that placeholder becomes a real Upgrade
CTA here.

- **(a) `out_of_credits` (402), owner — at the planner composer.** The AI entry
  (a faded compose bar + disabled **Plan** button) over a **blocked** `state`
  (`i-pause`, `--el-tint-yellow` icon): **"Planning is paused — you're out of
  credits"**, NAMING the limit ("all of this month's 2,000 Standard credits"),
  with an **active "Upgrade plan"** primary (`i-arrow-up`) + **"Buy credit
  top-up"** secondary. Existing plans stay editable.
- **(b) Tier-gate — free org that never bought AI.** A `gate` state (`i-sparkle`,
  `--el-tint-lavender`): **"AI planning is a paid feature"** with **"See AI
  plans"** primary + **"Maybe later"** ghost; mentions the 300 free trial
  credits.
- **(c) Member variant — can't buy.** A `gate` state (`i-lock`): **"AI is out of
  credits for this org"** with **"Ask an owner to upgrade"** — never a dead CTA
  (decision §7: a member's prompt routes to an owner).

### Panel 8 — empty / loading / error

- **(a) Empty / first-run** — no Stripe customer yet: a `state` (`i-card`),
  **"You're on the free plan"**, **"See plans"** CTA.
- **(b) Loading** — the panel `Skeleton` (`aria-busy`) while fetching status over
  7.1.
- **(c) Error** — the billing fetch failed (boundary/Stripe down): an error
  `state` (`i-alert`, `--el-tint-rose` icon), **"Couldn't load billing"**, "your
  subscription and credits are safe", a **Retry** secondary — not a
  broken-looking zero.
- A closing dashed `note` states the **cloud-only / `MOTIR_CLOUD`** gate
  (self-host hides everything here).

---

## Primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

Every surface composes a shipped `components/ui/*` primitive; the mock mirrors
the `ai-usage` mock's grammar so 8.1.7/8.1.8 reuse the same code. If they need a
genuinely new primitive, that is a **new `design/` subtask**, not a code
workaround.

- **`Popover` + menu rows (the access path, panel 1)** — the org menu's `opt`
  rows (the org-admin switcher grammar): rows at `--spacing-control-*` /
  `--radius-control`, the active **"Billing & plans"** row `--el-tint-lavender`.
- **`Card`** — every line (Motir / Motir AI / payment), the state cards, the
  plan cards, the loading skeleton wrapper (`--radius-card`, `--shadow-card`,
  `--spacing-card-padding`; head/body/foot split by `--el-border-soft`).
- **`Pill`** — the **subscription-status** chips (Active / Free trial / Past due /
  Canceled / View only), the **tier** chip, the **Motir-state** chip, the
  **Current** marker. `--radius-badge`, `--spacing-chip-*`; **hue in the tint
  BACKGROUND with `--el-text-strong` text (finding #35 — AA-safe), never a tinted
  page surface.**
- **`Button`** — primary (Upgrade / Change plan / Resubscribe), secondary (Manage
  plan / Portal / Retry / Contact owner), ghost (Maybe later / Update). Heights
  `--height-btn-md` / `--height-btn-sm`; padding `--spacing-btn-x[-sm]`.
- **`Segmented`** — the **Monthly / Annual** cadence toggle, now on **BOTH** the AI
  storefront (panel 5) **and the seat upgrade screen (panel 6a — 8.1.15)**: the
  shipped `components/ui/Segmented.tsx` grammar — an `--el-surface` track
  (`--radius-btn`, 2px inset), each option `calc(--radius-btn - 2px)` so it nests at
  any style, the active option `--el-page-bg` + `--shadow-subtle`. A `aria-pressed`
  group; the Annual option carries the `Save ~33%` badge. Reuse it — do not
  hand-roll. (Both screens hold a local `BillingCadence` state defaulting to
  `'annual'`; `SeatsView` gains it, mirroring `PlansView`.)
- **Plan-card use-case + cumulative-feature lines (panel 5 — token-only, NO new
  primitive)** — the per-tier `.use` line is `--el-text-secondary` at the card top
  (a `min-height` aligns the price rows); the cumulative `.flead` lead
  ("Everything in {prev}, plus") is a flush-left `--el-text-secondary` caption (its
  `i-check` glyph hidden) introducing the `i-check` (`--el-success`) incremental
  bullets. Both are plain styled text inside the existing `.plan` card — no new
  component.
- **`EmptyState` / `ErrorState` family** — the member gate (4b), the tier-gate +
  member paywall (6b/6c), empty/error (7a/7c).
- **`Skeleton`** — the loading panel (7b).
- **Meter / bar (token-only)** — the allotment meter + the free-cap meters are
  plain token-styled `div`s (radius + tint), no charting lib, no image — the same
  `.meter` pattern as `ai-usage`.
- **Avatar stack + seat calc (panel 6, panel 2 preview)** — the overlapping member
  **avatars** reuse the shipped member-avatar token grammar (`--radius-badge`,
  pastel `--el-tint-*` fills + `--el-text-strong`, a `--el-page-bg` ring); the
  `.seatcalc` row is a token-styled `Card`-like band (`--el-surface-soft`,
  `--radius-card`, `--el-border-soft`) — no new primitive. 8.1.7 sources the seat
  count from membership (the seat `quantity`), not a hand-typed number.

(`--radius-{btn,card,input,control,badge}`, `--spacing-{btn,input,control,chip,
card-padding}`, `--height-{btn-*,input,control}`, `--shadow-*`) — never the inert
Tier-0 radius/spacing scale or a fixed raw utility. `rounded-full`
(`--radius-badge`, `9999px`) is used only for the round avatar / pill caps.
Toggling the mock's dark mode confirms token parity (every colour flips through
Tier-0 under `--el-*`) — verified.

# Amendment 2026-07-30 — the Motir CI line (MOTIR-1902)

**Asset:** `ci-line.mock.html` + `ci-line.png` (this file is the third of the
three). **Base asset amended:** `billing.mock.html` + `billing.png` + everything
above in this file.

**What this amendment adds:** exactly one thing — a **third billed line, "Motir
CI"**, on the billing settings panel, in all the states it can hold.

**What it leaves UNTOUCHED — explicitly:**

- **① The Motir (seats) line and ② the Motir AI line.** Reproduced verbatim in
  panel 1 so the new line is reviewed in its real neighbourhood; not one token,
  string or control of either is changed.
- **The access path.** Organization settings → Billing & plans is shipped and
  already drawn (base panel 1). This amendment draws **no new door** — the CI line
  is new content inside a room the user can already reach.
- **The storefront (base panels 5–6), the paywall (7), the role gating (4), the
  subscription lifecycle states (3), and the payment card.** Untouched.
- **The base `<style>` block and the lucide sprite** are spliced into
  `ci-line.mock.html` **byte-identically** (asserted at build time), so the two
  assets cannot drift. New CSS is additive only and namespaced `.ci-*` where a
  collision was possible — see "Collisions found" below.

**Every number is traceable to a read.** `poolMinutes` · `consumedMinutes` ·
`remainingMinutes` · `overageMinutes` · `chargedCredits` · `memberCount` ·
`floorApplied` · `periodEnd` · `balance` · `state` · `applicable`. Nothing is
drawn that no read supplies; the admin/member split is the shipped
`AiAccessDTO.canManageBilling`.

## Primitives composed (no new primitive is introduced)

- **`Card`** — the CI line itself, same head/body grammar as ① and ②
  (`--radius-card`, `--shadow-card`, `--spacing-card-padding`).
- **`Meter` — the SHIPPED one**, `BillingClient.tsx`'s `Meter({ pct, low })`. It
  already carries the `low` → `--el-warning` variant this line needs, so the
  usage bar is a **reuse, not a new primitive**. The only addition is a 2px
  **pool-boundary tick** (`.meter.over .tick`, filled `--el-page-bg`) marking
  where the included pool ends inside a full bar.
- **`Pill`** — `Included` (mint), `Drawing on credits` (yellow), `CI paused`
  (yellow), `Nothing to bill` (neutral). Hue in the tint BACKGROUND with
  `--el-text-strong` text — AA-safe, finding #35.
- **`Button`** — `secondary` only, for both decision options (see below).
- **The `banner` / `note` / `state` / `Skeleton` family** — reused as-is from the
  base for the paused banner, the advisory notes, the error state and the loading
  row. The base `.sk` shimmer is reused verbatim, not redefined.

## Colour + shape roles (additions only — the base table above still governs)

| **Motir CI product glyph** (`i-zap`)   | `--el-tint-peach` bg + `--el-text-strong`          | The THIRD product hue. mint = Motir, lavender = Motir AI, so CI takes the unused peach slot — a different tint slot, never a new hue. |
| **`Included` pill**                    | `--el-tint-mint` + `--el-text-strong`, `i-check`   | Healthy, same family as the AI line's `Active`.                                                                                       |
| **`Drawing on credits` pill + banner** | `--el-tint-yellow` + `--el-text-strong`, `i-coins` | Warning family: you are now paying per minute — but nothing is blocked.                                                               |
| **`CI paused` pill + banner**          | `--el-tint-yellow` + `--el-text-strong`, `i-pause` | **Warning, NOT danger** — the base table already fixes this for the paused state ("nothing is broken").                               |
| **Meter fill, within allowance**       | `--el-accent`                                      | The shipped `Meter` default.                                                                                                          |
| **Meter fill, past the pool**          | `--el-warning`                                     | The shipped `Meter low` variant — same signal as the AI line's low-balance meter.                                                     |
| **Pool-boundary tick**                 | `--el-page-bg`                                     | A notch, not a colour — reads on any palette.                                                                                         |
| **Pool derivation line**               | `--el-text-muted`, figures `--el-text-secondary`   | Explains the number without competing with it.                                                                                        |
| **Decision option card**               | `--el-page-bg` on `--el-border`, `--radius-card`   | Two peers; neither is tinted, so neither reads as the recommended one.                                                                |
| **Cross-link to the AI balance**       | `--el-link`                                        | The §7.2 non-duplication rule: CI reports minutes and links for the balance.                                                          |

Shape: `--radius-card` (cards, banners, option cards), `--radius-badge` (pills,
meter), `--radius-control` (glyph, repo rows), `--spacing-card-padding`,
`--spacing-control-x/y`, `--height-btn-*`, `--shadow-card`. No Tier-0
`--color-*`, no raw `rounded-*`/`p-*`/`h-*`. Dark mode verified — every colour
flips through Tier 0 under `--el-*`.

in a real **1280 × 800** laptop viewport (≈700 px of usable page):

| Measurement                         | Result     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| CI card top (paused state, hoisted) | **85 px**  |
| Both consequence lines end by       | **367 px** |
| Both option buttons end by          | **415 px** |
| Fold                                | 700 px     |

- **Neither option is `primary`.** Both are `secondary` peers. One keeps the
  hosted arrangement and one ends it; dressing either as _the_ answer is Motir's
  thumb on the scale.
- **Each option states its real cost under it.** Add credits → "CI resumes within
  a minute of the payment landing — at most 15" (§B's latency, in the copy, not in
  the implementer's head). Move the repositories → a GitHub account you own, a
  transfer you accept on GitHub, and an app re-install — **never "one click"**.
- **The member variant renders NO disabled control.** A control a user cannot use
  is worse than a sentence explaining why. It routes to "an organization owner"
  and names nobody.

### ⚠️ The one ordering rule this amendment adds (panel 8)

Measured on the real page: in the normal order the CI card is **third and starts
at 756 px** — below a 700 px fold. A paused admin would land _above_ the decision
and have to scroll to find it, which fails §D's constraint in practice even
though the block itself fits. **Rule: when `state === 'ci_credits_exhausted'`,
the Motir CI card renders FIRST in the stack; otherwise it keeps third
position.** This orders by urgency without adding a second decision surface,
without a page-level banner to keep in sync, and without changing the CONTENT of
① or ② — they are byte-identical, just below. **MOTIR-1903 must implement this
ordering**, not only the card.

## Two corrections to MOTIR-1902's own card, made against the record

1. **"An org with no seat subscription" is NOT a render-nothing case.** The card
   grouped it with self-host and the meta org under "not applicable"; ADR **§4.3**
   decides the opposite — the pool is `max(members × 300, 1000)` regardless of
   subscription, because a free-tracker org can hold a paid AI plan. It renders a
   **normal** line (panel 5, right). Drawing it as "nothing" would have shipped
   the wrong branch.
2. **A state the card did not list is required by the DTO: `balance: null`**
   (motir-ai unreachable). It is a real value, is **never** treated as exhaustion —
   refusing on a transport blip would fail closed on Motir's own outage — and must
   **not** render as a misleading zero. Drawn in panel 6: the minutes half renders
   from local data; only the credits half says it is unavailable.

## Collisions found while composing (recorded so MOTIR-1903 does not repeat them)

Composing INTO a shipped asset is not the same as drawing beside it. Three real
defects surfaced only by rendering, not by reading:

1. **`.opt` already exists in the base** as the org-menu row (`align-items:
center; cursor: pointer`). The new decision-option cards silently inherited it
   and rendered centre-aligned. Renamed to **`.ci-opt` / `.ci-opts`**.
2. **`.sk` already exists** as a gradient shimmer. A redefinition would have
   downgraded it to a flat fill — the base one is reused verbatim instead.
3. **`.desc` is scoped as `.line .desc`.** Used outside the base's
   `.line > .meta` wrapper it falls back to default body size. Every `.desc` in
   this asset sits inside that wrapper.

**The lesson for the code card:** the CI line is a new component in an existing
client component; reuse `Meter`, `StatusPill`'s grammar and the card shell rather
than introducing parallel ones.

## Copy strings (en — the `billing` namespace; MOTIR-1903 adds each with a `zh` twin)

Every string below needs a matching `zh.json` key or the i18n-catalog parity gate
fails the PR (amendment §D).

- Line: **"Motir CI"** / **"The CI minutes Motir pays for on the repositories it
  hosts for you."**
- States: **"Included"** · **"Drawing on credits"** · **"CI paused"** ·
  **"Nothing to bill"**.
- Usage: **"Minutes used this month"** / **"{used} of {pool} minutes"** /
  **"{left} minutes left"** / **"{over} minutes over"**.
- Derivation: **"Your included minutes: {perSeat} min × {n} seats"** /
  **"Your included minutes: 1,000 minute minimum"**.
- Reset: **"Resets {date} — CI minutes run on the calendar month, so this is not
  the same date as your Motir AI renewal."**
- Overage: **"You're past your included minutes — CI is now drawing credits."** /
  **"{over} minutes over · {credits} credits drawn this period, at 1 credit per
  minute. Nothing is blocked."**
- Zero consumption: **"All of this project's repositories are your own"**, so
  GitHub bills you for Actions directly and Motir isn't paying for any CI. Your
  **"{pool} included minutes"** are there if you ever ask Motir to host a
  repository.
- Paused (admin): **"CI is paused — your credits ran out."** + the usage sentence
  - **"no workflows run"** on the repositories Motir hosts for you, and new work
    can't be dispatched. **"Nothing has been deleted, and your code is untouched."**
- Option A: **"Add credits"** / **"Top up your Motir AI balance. CI keeps running
  on Motir's repositories and the overage keeps drawing 1 credit per minute."** /
  **"CI resumes within a minute of the payment landing — at most 15."**
- Option B: **"Move the repositories to your own GitHub"** / **"GitHub bills you
  for Actions directly from then on, and Motir stops charging CI credits. The code
  is yours either way — this changes who pays for the compute."** / **"Needs a
  GitHub account you own, a transfer you accept on GitHub (it isn't instant), and
  re-installing the Motir app so dispatch keeps working."**
- Paused (member): **"CI is paused — this organization is out of credits."** +
  **"…until an organization owner adds credits or moves the repositories to your
  own GitHub."** + the lock note **"Billing for this organization is managed by
  its owners. There is no action for you here — this line is informational."**
- Balance unreachable: **"Your credit balance is temporarily unavailable. Your
  minutes are accurate and nothing is paused — only the balance figure is
  missing."**
- Pointers: **"Can't start this work — CI is paused"** / **"Manage CI minutes"** /
  **"CI is paused on the repositories Motir hosts — your own repositories are
  untouched, because GitHub bills those to you."**

# Amendment 2026-09-05 — the Motir Search line (MOTIR-4551)

The asset is **`search-line.mock.html`** + **`search-line.png`**, a NEW three-file
member of this area, under story **MOTIR-4334**. Its consuming code card is
**MOTIR-4557**, `blocked_by` this design gate; the read that feeds it is
**MOTIR-4555**.

It follows the structural precedent the CI line set one amendment up: **a billed
line that arrives after the panel shipped gets its OWN asset**, never an
amendment that re-exports `billing.mock.html` or `ci-line.mock.html`. Both of
those are byte-unchanged by this card. An asset records what was decided on the
day it was decided; re-exporting a frozen mock buries a new surface inside an old
one and makes the diff unreadable.

## THE SURFACE DECISION — recorded on motir-core's own side

**Search spend is its OWN billed line. It is not folded into the Motir AI figure,
and it is not a second usage kind on that line.**

This is **not re-taken here** — it is TRANSCRIBED, because until now it existed
only in two other repositories and a motir-core reader had nowhere to find it:

- **`motir-gateway/docs/decisions/motir-search-channel.md` §4.4** — _"The customer
  sees a search charge on their credit ledger as its own `kind`, alongside AI turns
  and Motir CI. It is not merged into the AI line."_
- **`motir-ai/docs/credit-model.md` §4b** — the same sentence, followed by that
  record's own standing warning that motir-core does not yet RENDER the line.

**Why it is worth writing down HERE.** The decision binds a motir-core surface and
is stated in two repositories a motir-core reader has no reason to open. That is
exactly how the gap this story exists to close was created: the mechanism shipped
with its decision recorded beside the mechanism, and the surface shipped nothing
because the decision was not recorded beside the surface.

**What this decision does NOT settle**, stated so a later card does not read it as
covering more than it does:

- **It does not decide the run-level drill-down.** _Which run spent it_ is the
  **usage dashboard's** question and has its own asset (MOTIR-4554) and its own
  code card (MOTIR-4558). This line answers _what am I charged for_ and links
  across, exactly as ② and ③ do. The two surfaces must not duplicate — the
  standing `ai-usage` ⟷ `billing` split at the top of this file governs here
  unchanged.
- **It does not decide pricing.** The rate, the margin and the env fail-safe are
  the gateway's (`motir-search-channel.md` §4.2) and this asset moves none of them.

## ⚠️ The two things this line does NOT have, and why each is a DECISION

**These are the parts a code card is most likely to add by analogy with ③ Motir
CI, so they are recorded as absences rather than left out.**

### 1. There is NO METER, because there is no denominator

② Motir AI meters its monthly allotment; ③ Motir CI meters its included pool. A
meter needs a number to divide by. Search has **no pool, no allowance and no
included quantity** — every search is charged, from the first one. A meter here
would have to invent the figure it fills against.

What replaces it is the **figure band** (`.figs` / `.fig`): two plain numbers,
_Spent this month_ and _Spent all time_, with the unit spelled `credits` and never
a currency (the area's standing rule).

### 2. There is NO PAUSED STATE, and it is a decision — `motir-search-channel.md` §5

**Every other billed line on this panel has an exhaustion story and this one does
not.** `motir-search-channel.md` §5 decides that an out-of-credit org is allowed
into **overdraft** and that **search refuses nothing**: a second refusal valve on
grounding would mean a balance state silently turns the planner code-blind at rung
1, and rung 1's failure is invisible by construction — the planner would not error,
it would go back to asserting from memory. Refusal stays at the planning-turn gate,
where it already is.

So panel 2c draws a balance at zero with **spend still accruing** and an
INFO banner saying so in words. It is `--el-tint-sky` / `--el-info`, deliberately
not the warning family: nothing is wrong and nothing is paused.

**For MOTIR-4557:** do not build a fourth pill tone, a pause banner, a hoisting
rule or a decision surface for search. ③ Motir CI's card-hoisting rule (this
file's earlier amendment, panel 8) is CI's alone and search does not join it —
there is no urgency for it to order by.

## ⚠️ UNAVAILABLE IS NOT ZERO — the one thing the code card must get exactly right

`BillingStatusDTO.search` is `SearchSpendDTO | null`, and `null` means **the
boundary did not report the block** — a rolling deploy where the motir-ai half has
not landed, not a customer who spent nothing.

**Drawn as an EM-DASH, never a `0`,** plus the dashed note _"Search figures aren't
available right now. Your searches are still being charged — this is the display,
not the billing."_

This is the same rule `ciFigures.ts` already ships as `balanceUnavailable` —
_"a real value, never exhaustion and never rendered as a misleading zero"_ — and
it matters more here, because search's honest zero is COMMON (an org whose runs
never search) while CI's is rare. A customer told they spent nothing on search
concludes they were not charged; there is no second surface that corrects them.

**And it is a PER-LINE treatment, never a page error.** Only this line's figures
are missing — ①②③ and the payment card are fed by other reads and are unaffected.
Panel 4c shows the page-level error state for contrast: that one is the SHIPPED
`ErrorState`, unchanged, and it takes all four lines with it.

This asset splices `ci-line.mock.html`'s token block verbatim, as that asset
splices `billing.mock.html`'s. **Two rules in that chain are STALE**: they were
copied before `billing.mock.html` corrected them, and they never fire in
`ci-line.mock.html` because it draws neither element.

| Rule            | `ci-line.mock.html` | `billing.mock.html` (corrected) | Measured                            |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `.state .ico`   | `--el-text-muted`   | `--el-text-secondary`           | 4.17:1 on `--el-surface` — fails AA |
| `.menu .mlabel` | `--el-text-faint`   | `--el-text-secondary`           | 2.39:1 — clears AA on NO surface    |

This asset follows the CORRECTED base and says so at each rule. The guard lane
(`tests/design-ink-contrast.test.ts`) is what found them — it fired the moment
this asset drew a `.state` block and an org menu, which is the first time either
rule had a user.

**Filed as a bug** against `ci-line.mock.html`, because the latent copy is a trap
for the NEXT asset that splices from it — which is exactly how it reached this one.

## Copy strings (en — the `billing` namespace; MOTIR-4557 adds each with a `zh` twin)

- Name: **"Motir Search"**
- Tagline: **"The web searches your planning runs make to ground themselves in
  current sources."**
- Chip: **"Per use"**
- Figures: **"Spent this month"** / **"Spent all time"** / **"{credits} credits"**
- Rate line: **"Each web search draws 1 credit from your Motir AI balance. There
  is no included allowance and nothing to run out of — search is charged only when
  a run uses it."**
- Nothing billed: **"No searches billed this month."** / **"Search is charged only
  when a planning run uses it, so nothing here means nothing was used — not that
  anything is unavailable."**
- Overdraft: **"Search keeps working when your balance runs out."** / **"An
  out-of-credit org goes into overdraft and search refuses nothing. Refusal stays
  at the planning-turn gate, where it already is."**
- Unavailable: **"Search figures aren't available right now. Your searches are
  still being charged — this is the display, not the billing."**
- Cross-link: **"See which runs spent it"**

## GIVES / TAKES

**GIVES — MOTIR-4557** the whole element set: the card and its header, the glyph
and its tint, the `Per use` chip, the figure band and its two labels, the
nothing-billed note, the overdraft banner, the unavailable dash and its note, the
loading shape, the cross-link, and the two ABSENCES above (no meter, no paused
state) as build instructions rather than omissions.

**TAKES — nothing from any other card.** No sibling's scope is narrowed and no
card is amended by this one. The access path is REPRODUCED from
`billing.mock.html` panel 1 rather than taken from it: the door already exists and
this line joins a panel that already has one, which is precisely what drawing it
here proves.

Its neighbours for the record, neither of them amended: **MOTIR-4554** draws the
same spend on the usage dashboard (the run-level drill-down this line links to and
does not own), and **MOTIR-4555** carries the figures across the boundary that
feed both.

# AMENDMENT 2026-09-05 — an INTERNAL org renders exactly what a paying org renders

**Story MOTIR-4337 · swept by card MOTIR-4564.** This area's assets describe a META org as a
tenant that sees an "Internal plan" card and **no CI line**. After MOTIR-4337 that description is
not merely stale — it is the opposite of what the product does, and a design note nobody corrects
is the specification the next agent builds to.

**What changes, and what does not.**

- **`isMeta` keeps its shipped meaning** — Motir's own COGS: caps lifted, AI paywall off, excluded
  from revenue. It gains no new one
  (`docs/decisions/internal-billing-classification.md` §1).
- **A new, separate `Organization.internalBilling` flag** means _charged exactly like a customer,
  then made whole_: every debit lands and is paired, in the SAME transaction, with an
  `internal_offset` credit, so the balance nets to zero **while both entries stay visible** (§2–§3).
- **So every billed line, its states and its figures render for an internal org exactly as for a
  paying org** — including low-balance and out-of-credits, which are precisely the states the
  suppression made unreachable from the seat most likely to notice a bug in them. The `isMeta`
  branch in `BillingClient.tsx` is **deleted**, not duplicated for the new flag (MOTIR-4572).
- **The CI line RENDERS rather than being hidden**, in whatever state `ciAllowanceService`
  returns. For a meta org that state is `bypassed`, and showing it is the point: the bypass itself
  stays keyed on `isMeta` (`ci-minutes-allowance.md` §4.4 — _"moooon B.V. pays its own GitHub bill
  directly; metering it would bill the house to itself"_), and charging a CI minute Motir never
  paid for and then offsetting it would put an invented figure on the very screen this story
  exists to make honest.

**The drawn META panels in this area are a record of superseded behaviour.**
`ci-line.mock.html` panel 5 and `search-line.mock.html` panel 3 draw the meta variant as it ships
today; each is annotated in place. They are **not redrawn here** — MOTIR-4572 owns the change to
the customer surfaces, and this sweep owns the note that stops them being read as the internal
org's future experience.
