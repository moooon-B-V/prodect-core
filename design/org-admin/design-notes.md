# Org administration — design notes

Design reference for the **`org-admin`** UI area — the **organization (root
tenancy tier) administration surfaces** (Story 6.10). The asset is the source of
truth for every UI subtask in Story 6.10. Built FROM the real design system
(`app/globals.css` `--el-*` colour tokens + `[data-display-style]` shape tokens +
the shipped `components/ui/*` primitives), so the code subtask composes the same
primitives — no Pencil→code gap.

## What this area is

Story 6.10 introduces the missing **top tenancy tier** above the workspace — the
**`Organization`** (the root account a customer signs up as, the parent of N
workspaces, and the **billing entity** credits + usage roll up to). It is
**auto-created at signup and renameable**; every customer is an org from day one,
so a one-person company (**OPC**) and an enterprise share one model and one set
of surfaces — the difference is purely **progressive disclosure** (see the rule
below), not a separate "individual" product. The org-admin surfaces are the
**tenant** owner/admin's controls for that tier:

- the **org switcher** in the app shell,
- **org settings** (name / slug / metadata),
- **cross-workspace member management** (the roster across all the org's
  workspaces, with an org-scoped role and add / remove / change-role).

A NEW org-scoped `OrganizationRole` (**owner / admin / member**) sits **above**
the 6.4 workspace `MemberRole`: an org owner/admin administers the org and is
granted admin on **every** workspace under it; an org member belongs to the org
but is governed inside each workspace by their workspace role.

**Membership direction is ASYMMETRIC (Yue).** Adding a user to a **workspace**
auto-creates their **org membership** (you can't be in a workspace without being
in its org — the upward invariant). Adding a user to the **org** does **not** put
them in any workspace: a plain org member reaches only the workspaces they're
**explicitly** added to (an org owner/admin still spans all _by role_). So an
**"org-only" member in zero workspaces is a valid state** (e.g. a billing admin) —
the roster shows "No workspaces" for them. Removing someone from the org revokes
all their workspace access; removing them from a workspace leaves the org
membership intact.

### Mirror product (rung 1 — cited, not asserted)

- **Atlassian / Jira Cloud** — the Organization is the topmost structure; it
  controls licensing, **billing** and security across sites. The **org admin** is
  the highest level of admin and the one who sees billing; site admins below do
  not. All org administration (users, billing, multiple sites) lives at
  `admin.atlassian.com` — a **distinct admin area** from a single site's
  settings. (Atlassian Community "Jira's Structure — Orgs, Sites, Spaces";
  Atlassian Support "types of admin roles".)
- **Linear** — a workspace is "the home for all issues in an organization"; the
  workspace **Owner** holds the org-root settings (members, billing, security);
  members belong to one-or-many teams under the root. Billing sits at the
  org/workspace **root**. (Linear Docs — Workspaces; Members and roles.)

Motir's `Organization` = the Atlassian org / Linear workspace-root (the
billing + identity root); Motir's `Workspace` ≈ an Atlassian site / a Linear
team-container under it.

### ⚠️ Out of scope here (named, NOT drawn)

- **Billing / credit / usage.** The org is the billing entity (Yue, locked), but
  6.10 ships **no** billing surface. The org-scoped usage/credit **view is
  7.12.5**; checkout/pricing is **Epic 8**. Org settings draws only a **passive
  "billing lives here later" placeholder** (the "Billing & usage" card with a
  "Coming soon" pill and a dashed note) — no active control.
- **The cross-ORG platform-staff superadmin console** that reads ACROSS all orgs
  is **Epic 10 / 10.1** — a SEPARATE platform-staff concept. This area is the
  **tenant** org-admin (the customer administering their own org), NOT that
  console.

---

## ⚠️ Progressive disclosure — the governing rule of the shell chrome

The data model **always** carries all three tiers (`Organization → Workspace →
Project`), auto-created at signup, so there is **never a migration** as a
customer grows. The **UI reveals a tier only when it offers a choice** — i.e.
when its count is at least two. "Scale" is not a mode the product detects; it
emerges from counts. There is **no "individual" branch**: a one-person company
(**OPC**) is just an organization with one member.

| Tier             | When it shows in the header                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Organization** | **Always** — the top-left anchor (a `Button` + `ChevronDown` opening its menu). Auto-created at signup, renameable. The menu's **"Switch organization" section appears only when the account belongs to ≥2 orgs.** |
| **Workspace**    | **Hidden until the org has a 2nd workspace.** One workspace is implicit and never shown. At ws #2 the workspace switcher appears to the RIGHT of the org (`Acme › Engineering`).                                   |
| **Project**      | **Always** — in the sidebar header (1.5.3), unchanged. Switching the workspace re-scopes it.                                                                                                                       |

So **only two count-driven reveals exist**: the workspace switcher at ws #2, and
the org menu's switch-org section at org #2. The same components render every
scale — OPC, small org, multi-workspace org, multi-org enterprise — by hiding any
tier whose count is 1. (Mirror: Atlassian shows the org picker "only when you
have more than one"; Linear's single-workspace view is equally clean.)

## Where it lives

- **Org control** — a new client component (mirror
  `app/(authed)/_components/WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx`) rendered in the **TopNav**
  (`app/(authed)/_components/TopNav.tsx`) as the **leftmost** anchor, ALWAYS
  present. It is a menu button (org avatar + name + `ChevronDown`), not only a
  switcher: the menu carries **Settings · Members · Billing & usage (Coming
  soon) · New workspace**, then — **only when the account is in ≥2 orgs** — a
  **"Switch organization"** section (the org list + **Create organization**).
- **Workspace switcher** — the shipped `WorkspaceSwitcher`, rendered to the
  RIGHT of the org with a `›` separator (`--el-text-faint`) **only when the
  active org has ≥2 workspaces**. Below that threshold it is not rendered at
  all. So the header reads `Acme` (1 ws) → `Acme › Engineering` (2+ ws).
- **Settings — collapsed at one workspace, but the workspace tier still does
  the work underneath.** The data is ALWAYS 3 tiers, and **workspace-scoped
  config keeps living on the `Workspace` row** (workflows, statuses, custom
  fields, labels, components, automation, dashboards, saved filters, workspace
  members — all `workspaceId`-scoped in the schema today). What collapses is
  only the _surface_:
  - **At ONE workspace:** a **single Settings area**, entered from the org menu,
    that renders **both** the org-scoped sections (org name / slug / billing
    placeholder / org members / danger zone) **and** the workspace-config
    sections — and **each section persists to its own tier underneath** (org →
    `Organization`, workspace-config → the single `Workspace`). The org settings
    "pass through" to the workspace's settings; there is **no separate
    `/settings/workspace` surface shown**, but the workspace settings are still
    the underlying mechanism being written. This avoids showing a small team an
    org-vs-workspace split that is 1:1 for them.
  - **At ≥2 workspaces:** the workspace-config sections **split out** into a
    per-workspace Settings surface (scoped by the active workspace), and the org
    Settings page keeps only the org-scoped sections. The existing workspace's
    data does not move; the **new** workspace is **seeded by copying the source
    workspace's config at creation** (see below).
  - **"Inherit" is a BEHAVIOURAL ILLUSION, not a data relationship — there is NO
    org→workspace config inheritance in the model.** Config is purely
    `Workspace`-scoped; there are no org-level config defaults, no override rows,
    and no runtime resolution. The inherited _feel_ is achieved by
    **copy-on-create**: when a 2nd (or Nth) workspace is created, its config is
    **seeded by copying the source workspace's** workflows / statuses / fields /
    labels / components / automation / dashboards, so it opens already configured
    like the first one. After that the workspaces are fully independent — either
    can "overwrite" freely, with no link back. (Deliberately simpler than Jira's
    shared-scheme live inheritance; we get the consistent-defaults UX without the
    two-level config machinery. If real live inheritance is ever needed for
    enterprise, it's an additive future change, not a migration.)
  - Suggested routes: `app/(authed)/settings/organization/page.tsx` (org-scoped:
    general + billing placeholder + danger zone) and
    `app/(authed)/settings/organization/members/page.tsx` (the paginated roster);
    the existing `app/(authed)/settings/workspace/*` is the workspace-config
    surface that is **folded into** the org Settings page at one workspace and
    **re-surfaced standalone** at ws ≥ 2.

    ⚠️ **GATED PER SECTION, NOT PER PAGE** (MOTIR-3519 · `organization-tier.md`
    §6d). This line previously read "All org-owner/admin gated", four lines below
    the fold-in it describes — so the host refused the very people whose sections
    were being folded into it. A workspace invitee is a plain org `member`, and
    the collapse would have left them no route to their team roster and **no route
    to Leave workspace at all**. The corrected rule:
    - **org-scoped** sections (org name, billing, org danger zone, the roster) —
      org **owner/admin** only; a plain org member gets panel 5d's forbidden
      treatment **for those sections**, which is what 5d means once the page hosts
      two tiers;
    - **folded-in workspace** sections — any member **of that workspace**, the same
      gate the standalone area applies at ws ≥ 2 (rename and delete are
      membership-gated, not admin-gated, so this widens nothing);
    - **non-member of the org** — 404, never 403, unchanged.

    The general form, which every surface built on §6 inherits: **relocating a
    surface preserves its gate.** A hidden tier may change what the product NAMES,
    never what a user may DO.

The page shells reuse the `/items` + workspace-settings grammar: a serif `h2`
title + a muted subtitle, then a `stack` of `Card`s.

## Panels (review EACH — mistake #31)

### Panel 1 — progressive disclosure in the shell

The panel is a **ladder** demonstrating the count-driven reveal (above), not a
single switcher state:

- **A · 1 org · 1 workspace (top-left).** The header shows **only the org**
  (`Acme ▾`) as the top-left anchor; the **workspace is not shown at all**. The
  sidebar header carries the **project** switcher (`Mobile App ▾`). _This is the
  identical header for an OPC and for a 10-person small org — there is no
  individual mode._
- **B · 2+ workspaces (top-right).** The workspace switcher has appeared to the
  RIGHT of the org with a `›` separator (`Acme › Engineering`). This is the ONLY
  thing that surfaces the middle tier. Switching it re-scopes the sidebar project
  switcher.
- **C · the `Acme ▾` org menu, open (bottom).** One menu behind the org name:
  - **Settings · Members · Billing & usage (Coming soon) · New workspace** ("Adds
    the workspace switcher" — the discoverable path to reveal tier 2),
  - then a separator and the **"Switch organization"** section — **rendered only
    when the account is in ≥2 orgs**: one row per org with a `Check`
    (`--el-accent`, on the active org) + org avatar + "{n} workspaces" + the
    viewer's **org-role `Pill`**, plus **Create organization**.

**The load-bearing rule:** org is permanent top-left chrome; workspace is hidden
until ws #2; the org's switch-org list is hidden until org #2. (No "quiet label
vs dropdown" branch — the org is always a menu button; what its menu _contains_
is what scales.)

### Panel 2 — org settings (populated)

A `stack` of three `Card`s on the org-scoped settings page:

- **General** — `Input` fields: **Organization name**, **Contact email**.
  A header `Pill pill-owner` ("You're an owner"). Card foot: a "{n} workspaces ·
  {n} members" summary + a primary **Save changes** button.
  > **Amended 2026-08-10 (MOTIR-2548).** This card also drew an **Organization
  > URL** row — `motir.co/` + the slug, read-only, with a lowercase/hyphen hint.
  > It is removed. `docs/decisions/organization-url.md` records why: Motir does
  > not adopt organization-addressable URLs, nothing in the product resolves
  > `motir.co/<slug>`, and the row's own helper text ("used in links to this
  > organization") described a capability that does not exist.
  > `Organization.slug` survives as an internal column — it is simply no longer
  > a value anyone is shown.
- **Billing & usage** — the **PASSIVE placeholder** (a "Coming soon" neutral
  `Pill` + a dashed `note` reading that billing/credits/usage land later — org
  usage view 7.12.5, checkout Epic 8 — with **no active control**). This card
  exists so the layout stays stable when billing lands; it is NOT a billing UI.
- **Danger zone** — a destructive "Delete organization" `secondary`/`danger`
  button + the irreversibility copy (header in `--el-danger-text`).

**At one workspace, this page also folds in the workspace-config sections**
(workflows, statuses, custom fields, labels, components, automation, dashboards
— the existing `settings/workspace/*` surfaces), rendered below the org-scoped
cards as the same `stack` grammar. They are NOT redrawn in this org-admin asset
(they're owned by their own design areas); the org settings page simply hosts
them and writes them to the `Workspace` row underneath. At ws ≥ 2 these sections
move to a per-workspace Settings surface and this page keeps only the org-scoped
cards above. See "Settings — collapsed at one workspace" under _Where it lives_.

### Panel 3 — cross-workspace member management (PAGINATED)

The **roster of everyone across the org's workspaces**. One `Card` titled
**People** with a count `Pill` and an **"Invite to organization…"** `Combobox`
trigger in the header. Each member row (extends the workspace `MembersCard`
grammar):

- avatar + name (+ "(you)") + email,
- **workspace chips** (`pill-ws`, peach tint) naming which of the org's
  workspaces they belong to, with a **`+N` overflow** neutral pill when there are
  more than fit,
- the **org-role `Combobox`** (owner / admin / member) — except the **owner-self
  row**, whose role action is a disabled "Owner" affordance (you can't change
  your own owner role here),
- a **Remove** action (or **Revoke** for a pending invite row).
- A **pending-invite row** (faint avatar, "Invitation sent · awaiting
  acceptance", a "Pending" neutral pill) shows the invited-not-yet-joined state.

**⚠️ At-scale (finding #57 — NOT load-all).** The roster is **paginated**: a card
foot reads **"Showing 1–5 of 14"** + a **Prev / Page X of Y / Next** pager (Prev
disabled on page 1). A large org has hundreds of members across many workspaces —
the code subtask (6.10.5) MUST fetch a page at a time (the 6.10.4 service's
paginated `listMembers`), never `load-all`. Cursor or offset paging is
acceptable; the design shows page-numbered offset paging to match the count
display.

### Panel 4 — org-role + invite affordances

- **Org-role select OPEN** (owner / admin / member) with a one-line description
  per role, + a **role-explanation block** below it: an **owner/admin** pill row
  ("administer the org and are granted admin on **every** workspace under it") and
  a **member** pill row ("belongs to the org but … governed by their **workspace
  role** (the 6.4 MemberRole)"). This is where the design **distinguishes the org
  role from the workspace role** in writing.
- **Invite-to-organization picker OPEN** — a search `Combobox` over existing
  workspace members ("in workspace" meta) **plus** an **"Invite '…'"** send-email
  option for an address not yet present. Foot copy: invited people pick up the
  chosen org role; existing workspace members can be promoted to an org role here.
- An **info `note`**: _"Org membership gates workspace access: someone removed
  from the organization loses access to every workspace under it."_ (the 6.10.4
  gating decision, surfaced to the admin).

### Panel 5 — empty / loading / error + permission states

- **(a) Empty** — first-run / single-member org: an `EmptyState` ("It's just you
  so far") with an **Invite people** primary CTA.
- **(b) Loading** — the paginated-roster **`Skeleton`** (avatar + two lines +
  a chip placeholder per row), `aria-busy` / `aria-live="polite"` on the body.
- **(c) Error** — the roster fetch failed: an `ErrorState` (rose icon tint,
  "Couldn't load members") with a **Retry** secondary button.
- **(d) Forbidden** — signed in as an org **member** (not owner/admin): a gated
  `state` ("Organization settings are admin-only", lock icon, lavender tint) with
  a **Back to workspace** action — **the controls are NOT rendered** for a
  non-admin. (Distinct from the cross-tenant **404-not-403** posture for a
  non-org-member, which is a route-level not-found, not this in-app gated panel.)

---

## Primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

Every surface composes a shipped `components/ui/*` primitive. If 6.10.5 needs a
genuinely new primitive, that is a **new `design/` subtask**, not a code
workaround.

- **`Card`** — settings cards, the members card, the state panels (`--radius-card`,
  `--shadow-card`, `--spacing-card-padding`; head/body/foot regions split by
  `--el-border-soft`).
- **`Button`** — primary (Save, Invite people, Back to workspace), secondary
  (Retry), ghost (row Remove/Revoke), danger (Delete organization). Heights
  `--height-btn-md` / `--height-btn-sm`; padding `--spacing-btn-x[-sm]`.
- **`Popover` + `Combobox`** — the org switcher menu, the invite picker, the
  per-row org-role select, the per-row search. `--radius-card` container,
  `--shadow-elevated`, rows at `--spacing-control-*` / `--radius-control`.
- **`Input`** — the org-settings fields (`--height-input`, `--spacing-input-*`,
  `--radius-input`); the URL field uses a `--el-text-secondary` `motir.co/` prefix.
- **`Pill`** — org-role chips (see colour roles below), workspace chips, the
  count + pending + "Coming soon" neutral pills. `--radius-badge`,
  `--spacing-chip-*`; **hue in the tint BACKGROUND with `--el-text-strong` text
  (finding #35 — AA-safe), never a tinted page surface.**
- **`EmptyState` / `ErrorState`** family — panels 5a/5c/5d.
- **`Skeleton`** — panel 5b loading roster.
- **`Tooltip`** — the read-only / disabled-affordance explainer grammar (ink bg,
  `--el-text-inverted`).
- **Pagination** — a list-foot pager (count text + Prev/Next + page indicator).
  Reuse the at-scale list pattern Story 6.4 / the issues list established; do NOT
  hand-roll a new control.
- **Org avatar** — a small `--radius-control` square initial chip (lavender tint
  by default; per-org tint when shown in the switcher list), distinct from the
  round **user** avatar.

## Colour roles (`--el-*` — palette, not grey-only · finding #54)

| Element                           | Token                                                   | Why                                                                        |

| **Org-role: owner**               | `--el-tint-lavender` bg + `--el-text-strong`            | The highest, special role — the brand-purple family; carries a crown icon. |
| **Org-role: admin**               | `--el-tint-sky` bg + `--el-text-strong`                 | Distinct blue tint, clearly below owner.                                   |
| **Org-role: member**              | `--el-tint-mint` bg + `--el-text-strong`                | Green tint — the baseline tier, still coloured (not bare grey).            |
| **Workspace-membership chips**    | `--el-tint-peach` bg + `--el-text-strong`               | "Scope" chips read as a different category from the role chip.             |
| **Count / pending / coming-soon** | `--el-surface` + `--el-text-secondary` (neutral `Pill`) | Genuinely neutral metadata.                                                |

Tier-0 radius/spacing scale or a fixed raw utility. `rounded-full` (`9999px`) is
used only for the round user avatar and status dots. Toggle the mock's dark mode
to confirm token parity (every colour flips through Tier-0 under `--el-*`).

# Members seat / billing affordances (scaled org) — Story 8.1 · 8.1.13

> **Asset:** `members-billing.mock.html` + `members-billing.png` (this section is
> the third file of the THREE-file set). Subtask **8.1.13 (MOTIR-1260)**, the
> design gate **8.1.14 / MOTIR-1261** (the UI code) is `blocked` behind.

## What this is

The **seat / billing affordances LAYERED ONTO the existing org Members admin**
(6.10 · `settings/organization/members` · `OrgMembersClient`) for a **SCALED**
org. The members page already ships with zero billing content;
**8.1.12 (MOTIR-1256)** now keeps the Stripe seat `quantity` in sync with org
membership (prorated, charged promptly via Stripe `always_invoice`), but its
in-context UI was undesigned. Design-before-code (**Principle #13**) requires
THIS asset before the UI lands. This **extends** the org-admin area — it does NOT
replace the `org-admin.mock.html` roster; it adds the seat layer on top of it.

### Grounded in (read at run time — NOT invented)

- **`design/billing/design-notes.md` PANEL 6** — the seat model + proration copy:
  one seat per org **member**; **annual default $40/seat/yr** (6 × $40 = **$240 /
  yr**, ~$20/mo equiv); **add** a member → a **prorated CHARGE** for the rest of
  the term; **remove** → a **prorated CREDIT** on the next invoice, **NO mid-term
  refund**; seats track membership automatically (Linear's "seats = active
  members, prorated" model).
- **8.1.12 (MOTIR-1256) timing** — Stripe `proration_behavior: 'always_invoice'`
  → the added seat's prorated share is invoiced **+ collected NOW** (charged
  promptly), **NOT deferred to the annual renewal**. The add-member copy reads
  "**~$X charged now**, prorated to your renewal" to reflect this exactly (the
  default `create_prorations` would hold it to renewal = a free-seat loophole the
  decision rejects).
- **8.1.4c (MOTIR-1248)** — `Organization.scaledTrackerSubscription`
  (`{ status: active|past_due|canceled, priceId, currentPeriodEnd }`) is the
  **scaled-vs-free signal** every surface here gates on. `null` (free) → no seat
  UI.
- **`design/org-admin/design-notes.md`** (this file) — the members roster grammar
  the seat layer extends.

### Cloud-only + scaled-only (decision §6) · NO pay-wall (Linear-style)

Every surface here is gated behind **`MOTIR_CLOUD`** _and_ an **active** scaled
subscription. A **free** org and a **self-hosted** (GPL-3.0) build see the
members page **UNCHANGED** — no seat band, no cost notes (panel 4 draws this).
There is **no pay-wall**: inviting always works; the seat count and the next
invoice adjust automatically — the cost note is **informational, never a gate**.

### Permissions (decision §7)

Billing **mutations are owner-only**; an org **admin** can still manage
**membership** (add/remove — which moves seats) but does **not** own the seat
plan. So the admin view shows the seat count **read-only**, drops the "Manage
seats in Billing" CTA, and carries a "billing managed by an owner" note (panel
6). A plain org **member** never reaches this admin page at all (the org-admin
**panel 5d forbidden** state) — so "no cost actions for a non-billing-admin" is
realised as the org-**admin** treatment here.

## Design-against-shipped-reality (rendered, not redrawn)

The surface mirrors the **shipped `OrgMembersClient.tsx` EXACTLY** — a `Card`
with a head (`<h2>People</h2>` + a neutral count `Pill` left; a **secondary
`Invite` `Button`** with a `Mail` icon right) and a foot (the at-scale pager);
the body is a `<ul>` of member rows (avatar · name(+"(you)") · email · workspace
chips · a per-row org-role `Combobox` — a `Pill` + disabled affordance for the
self row · a ghost `Remove` `Button`). **Invite opens a `Modal`** (email `Input`

- role `Combobox` + the `roleHelp.gatingNote` paragraph + Cancel / Send). The
  seat layer is **added** to that reality; nothing is a redrawn stand-in. (The
  older `org-admin.mock.html` panel 3 drew the invite as a `Combobox` trigger — the
  SHIPPED component is a `Button`+`Modal`, which is what this asset matches.)

## Panels (review EACH — mistake #31)

### Panel 1 — scaled + active (the primary view + the access path)

The Members page for a scaled org. The **access path IS the existing Members
page** (crumb `Organization · {org} · Members`) — the door is the page itself; no
new nav. The new element is a **seat-summary band** at the **top of the People
card body** (above the roster), in-context where the seat count lives:

- a lavender product glyph (`i-layers`, the Motir glyph from billing panel 2),
- **"6 of 6 seats · $240 / yr"** (seats = active members), a **"Scaled"** mint
  status `Pill`, an **"Annual · saves $120/yr"** `save` pill,
- sub: _"Seats follow membership — 1 per active member ($40/seat/yr). Adding or
  removing a member adjusts your next invoice automatically (prorated)."_,
- a **"Manage seats in Billing"** `xlink` (`i-external`) → billing panel 6.

Below, the shipped roster (6 members = 6 seats) + the pager. A closing **info
`note`** states the **no-pay-wall** rule.

### Panel 2 — add a member (prorated-charge note · always_invoice)

The shipped Invite **`Modal`** (email `Input` filled, role `Combobox` "Member",
the gating `fhint`), now carrying a **one-line cost note** (a mint band, `i-user-
plus` accent glyph) directly above the footer:

> **Adds a seat.** ~**$33 charged now**, prorated to your 1 Jul 2026 renewal. Your
> plan goes from $240 to **$280 / yr** (7 seats).
> _Seats follow membership — you're not picking a plan. Stripe bills the prorated
> seat to your card on file; remove the member later for a prorated credit._

"Charged now" reflects 8.1.12's `always_invoice`. Footer: **Cancel** (ghost) /
**Send invite** (primary, `i-mail`). **No pay-wall** — Send always works.

### Panel 3 — remove a member (prorated-credit confirm)

The row's ghost **Remove** gains a **confirm popover** (a `Popover`, anchored to
the button) that discloses the **credit** before the seat-affecting change — the
shipped one-click remove is too consequential when it changes the bill:

> **Remove Mo from moooon?**
> _(i-user-minus)_ **Frees a seat** (6 → 5). A prorated credit for the unused time
> posts to your next invoice — **no mid-term refund**. Your plan returns to $200 /
> yr at renewal.
> _(i-info)_ They lose access to every workspace under moooon.
> [ Cancel ] [ **Remove** (danger) ]

The target row gets a **surface highlight + accent inset bar** (`--el-surface-
soft` + `box-shadow: inset 2px 0 0 --el-accent`) — **not** `opacity` (opacity
would form a stacking context and bleed transparency into the popover child; the
roster card's `overflow: hidden` also means the popover must float over rows
_within_ the card, not past its edge — both are real-component constraints the
8.1.14 code must respect, e.g. by portaling the Radix `Popover`). **A free org
keeps the one-click remove** (no confirm, no cost — panel 4).

### Panel 4 — free org + self-host (UNCHANGED · the gated difference)

Side-by-side: (left) the free-org Members page — **same People card, NO seat
band**, the roster, the pager; (right) the free-org Invite `Modal` — **NO cost
note**. A `note` states self-host is identical: with `MOTIR_CLOUD` off or no
active scaled subscription, the seat band and every cost note are gone — Motir is
unbounded and free within its caps.

### Panel 5 — past_due (dunning · seats still editable)

The seat band's **warning variant** (a `--el-tint-yellow` band, `i-alert`
`--el-warning` glyph, a **"Past due"** `pill-pastdue`): _"We couldn't charge your
card for the Motir seat plan. Motir stays active while we retry over the next ~2
weeks — **seats are still editable**. Update your payment method to avoid dropping
to the free caps."_ + an **"Update payment"** primary (`i-card`). Roster controls
stay fully editable. Grounds in **billing panel 3a** (keep-through-grace dunning).

### Panel 6 — non-admin for billing (org admin · owner-only billing)

An org **admin** (can manage membership, does NOT own the seat plan). The seat
band is **read-only**: **"6 of 6 seats · $240 / yr"** + **"Scaled"** + a **"View
only"** neutral `Pill` (`i-eye`), **no "Manage seats" CTA**, and a lock `costnote`
(`i-lock`): _"Billing is managed by an owner. Adding or removing a member still
adjusts the org's seats — the charge or credit is handled on the owner's plan."_
The roster stays manageable (admins manage membership). The page subtitle states
the split. _(A plain org member is gated out entirely — org-admin panel 5d.)_

## Primitives composed (no hand-rolling)

Every surface composes a shipped `components/ui/*` primitive (the same set the
6.10 members page already uses), so 8.1.14 reuses the shipped code:

- **`Card`** — the People card (head / body / foot), `--radius-card`,
  `--shadow-card`, `--spacing-card-padding`; regions split by `--el-border-soft`.
- **`Button`** — secondary `Invite` (`--height-btn-sm`, `i-mail`); ghost row
  `Remove`; primary `Send invite` / `Update payment`; danger `Remove` (in the
  confirm). Heights `--height-btn-{sm,md}`; padding `--spacing-btn-x[-sm]`.
- **`Pill`** — the count (neutral), the **"Scaled"** (mint), **"Past due"**
  (yellow), **"View only"** (neutral, `i-eye`), org-role chips (owner=lavender /
  admin=sky / member=mint), workspace chips (peach). `--radius-badge`,
  `--spacing-chip-*`; **hue in the tint BACKGROUND with `--el-text-strong`
  (finding #35 — AA-safe), never a tinted page surface.**
- **`Combobox`** — the per-row org-role select + the Modal's role select
  (`--height-control`, `--radius-input`, `--spacing-control-*`).
- **`Input`** — the Modal's email field (`--height-input`, `--spacing-input-*`,
  `--radius-input`).
- **`Modal`** — the Invite dialog (overlay `bg-black/40`; panel `--radius-modal`,
  `--spacing-card-padding`, `--shadow-modal`; serif title).
- **`Popover`** — the Remove confirm (`--radius-card` container,
  `--shadow-elevated`). **Portal it** so the card's `overflow: hidden` can't clip
  it (the portal-popover-in-overflow rule).
- **Seat band / cost note** — a token-styled band reusing billing's `.seatcalc`
  grammar (`--el-surface-soft`, `--radius-card`, `--el-border-soft`); the glyph
  chip is `--radius-control`. No new primitive. The `save` pill reuses billing's
  `.save` (`--el-tint-mint` + `--el-text-strong`). **8.1.14 sources the seat
  count from membership** (the same source 8.1.12 syncs to Stripe), never a
  hand-typed number; the `$` figures come from the scaled-subscription state.
- **Pager** — the shipped at-scale list-foot pager (unchanged from 6.10).

`--shadow-*`) — never the inert Tier-0 radius/spacing scale or a fixed raw
utility. `rounded-full` (`9999px`, via `--radius-badge`) is used only for the
round user avatar and pill caps. Toggling the mock's dark mode confirms token
parity (every colour flips through Tier-0 under `--el-*`).

## The require-2FA policy control (Story 8.13 · 8.13.1)

**Asset:** `security-policy.mock.html` + `security-policy.png`. Gates **8.13.5**
(MOTIR-3646, the org pane) and **8.13.6** (MOTIR-3647, the workspace control).
The member-facing half — the forced-enrolment screen a non-compliant person
meets — is **8.13.2**'s (MOTIR-3643) and lands in the **`design/auth`** area
beside the two-factor challenge and passkey sign-in screens; it is not drawn
here.

### What this asset owns, and what it deliberately does not

It owns **one card**, its **two access paths**, and the **locked state**. It
**COMPOSES** two surfaces it does not re-specify:

- `design/workspaces/settings.pen` / `settings.png` owns the workspace settings
  page. This asset adds a pane to it; it does not redraw it.
- `design/org-admin/org-admin.mock.html` owns the org settings home, and its
  **panel 5d** owns the refusal treatment reused verbatim in panel 8.
- `design/settings/arrival.mock.html` owns the settings-pane arrival frame,
  composed in panel 9. This pane adds **no `loading.tsx`** — see the arrival note
  below.

### ⚠️ Two primitives MOVED since `org-admin.mock.html` was drawn

This asset follows the shipped components, not its predecessor in this folder.
Both differences are visible in the export and both matter to the implementer:

| primitive | what `org-admin.mock.html` draws                                                   | what ships today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Card`    | a bordered header strip (`.card-head` with a `border-bottom`), padding on the body | ONE padded box — `rounded-(--radius-card) border border-(--el-border) p-(--spacing-card-padding)` on `--el-card`, whose `header` slot is a plain block with `mb-(--spacing-md)` and whose `footer` slot adds `border-t` + `mt/pt-(--spacing-md)` |
| `Switch`  | n/a (that asset draws none)                                                        | `h-5 w-9` (36×20) with a 14px knob; checked fill `--el-switch-on`, knob `--el-switch-knob`, unchecked track `--el-muted` on a `--el-border-strong` border; `disabled` is `opacity-50` + `cursor-not-allowed`                                     |

Build to the table's right-hand column. `AcceptanceVideoCard.tsx` is the shipped
worked example of exactly this card shape (an org-level boolean policy with a
`Switch` on the right of a label row), and 8.13.5 should read it before writing.

### The panels

| #   | panel                                 | what it shows                                                                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Access path A — the org menu**      | `OrgControl.tsx`'s menu with **Security** inserted directly under Settings.                                                      |
| 2   | **Access path B — the settings rail** | `SidebarNav.tsx`'s bottom section with **Security** added, AND the same rail below the reveal threshold where the row is ABSENT. |
| 3   | **Off**                               | Nobody is required. The body copy carries the consequences.                                                                      |
| 4   | **On, set at this tier**              | The org control, operable, with the state named in text.                                                                         |
| 5   | **Locked on, mandated above**         | The workspace control when the org already requires it.                                                                          |
| 6   | **On here AND above**                 | Set locally, then mandated by the org too.                                                                                       |
| 7   | **The fold-in**                       | The workspace card hosted on `/settings/organization` for a single-workspace org, below the org card.                            |
| 8   | **Refused**                           | Panel 5d's `EmptyState`, replacing the CARD and not the page.                                                                    |
| 9   | **Arrival**                           | `SettingsPaneFrame` as the in-page `<Suspense>` fallback.                                                                        |
| 10  | **Dark**                              | Three of the states again with the tokens flipped.                                                                               |

### ⚠️ The locked state is the one an implementer will otherwise improvise

**The switch is `disabled`, NOT absent.** A missing control tells a workspace
admin nothing, and a live control that silently does nothing is worse than both.
The indicator is a **`Pill`** — never bespoke markup — carrying
**"Required by {org}"**, so the organization is named: a person denied a switch
is owed the name of whoever holds it.

**The Pill is `--el-tint-sky` with `--el-text-strong` ink, and it is NOT
`--el-danger`.** `design/settings/design-notes.md`'s shipped ruling applies:
nothing has gone wrong here, something was decided elsewhere. Sky rather than
lavender because lavender is already the org-role chip's tone in this area, and
the two must not read as the same class of thing. Hue in the tint BACKGROUND with
`--el-text-strong` text is what keeps it AA in both themes.

**Panels 5 and 6 are DIFFERENT states and must not be collapsed.** MOTIR-3644
stores the two tiers as two columns rather than their OR precisely so that
"the workspace chose this too" survives the org switching its own off. Panel 6's
copy says both; panel 5's says only the org. An implementer who renders one
treatment for both loses the distinction the schema was shaped to keep.

### ⚠️ The fold-in decides the layout (MOTIR-3502 · `organization-tier.md` §6d)

Below **two** workspaces in the active org, `/settings/workspace` **404s**
(`resolveWorkspaceTierDisclosure` → `notFound()`), and its sections are hosted on
`/settings/organization` by `WorkspaceFoldInSection` — _"a MOUNT, not a
rewrite"_. So the workspace require-2FA control has **two homes**, and a design
that drew only `/settings/workspace/security` would describe a surface most
organizations cannot reach. Panel 7 draws the second home: the identical card,
below the org-scoped cards, in the same `stack` grammar the fold-in already uses
for Name / Members / Danger zone. **It is the same component mounted twice, never
a second drawing.**

**The rail row follows the same threshold, and this is where this pane departs
from its neighbours.** `SidebarNav.tsx` says outright that Job runs and Git are
NOT gated on the reveal, because they are workspace-SCOPED but not
workspace-NAMED. `/settings/workspace/security` **is** workspace-named and 404s
below the threshold, so its row must be hidden there or it points at a 404.
Panel 2's right half is that state.

### Arrival

Panel 9 is `SettingsPaneFrame`, rendered as the fallback of an in-page
`<Suspense>` placed **after** the pane's own gate. The real header (`<h1>` +
subtitle) is painted ABOVE the boundary, so it is on screen immediately and no
placeholder covers it. **Do NOT add a `loading.tsx`** — `CLAUDE.md`'s rule
applies: a route-level boundary flushes the response head and fixes the status at
200, and this pane's siblings under `settings/` decide existence.

### Primitives composed

| element                   | primitive                        | tokens                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The policy card           | `Card`                           | `--el-card` fill, `--el-border`, `--radius-card`, `--spacing-card-padding`; header slot `mb-(--spacing-md)` |
| Card title                | `<h3>` in the header slot        | `--el-text`, 16px/600                                                                                       |
| Card body copy            | `<p>` in the header slot         | `--el-text-muted` — safe here because the card fill IS the white page/card surface                          |
| State label               | `<span>`                         | `--el-text-secondary` off, `--el-text` on                                                                   |

| Locked indicator          | `Pill`                           | `--el-tint-sky` background, `--el-text-strong` ink, `--radius-badge`, `--spacing-chip-x/y`                  |
| Locked explanation        | `<p>`                            | `--el-text-secondary`, `mt-(--spacing-md)`                                                                  |
| Refusal                   | `EmptyState` (which is a `Card`) | glyph `--el-icon-muted`, title `--el-text`, description `--el-text-subtitle`                                |
| Arrival blocks            | `SettingsPaneFrame`              | `--el-muted` fill, `--radius-control`                                                                       |
| Org menu                  | `Popover` + menu rows            | `--el-border`, `--shadow-elevated`, `--radius-card`; rows `--radius-control`, `--spacing-control-x/y`       |
| Rail rows                 | `Sidebar` rows                   | `--el-text-secondary`, active `--el-surface`, `--radius-control`                                            |
| The `›` context separator | `<span aria-hidden>`             | `--el-text-faint` — **decorative only**, which is what makes that ink legitimate                            |

No Tier-0 `--color-*` is referenced by any element rule (only the `:root` /
`[data-theme='dark']` token blocks define them), and no raw `rounded-*` / `p-*` /
`h-*` appears. The one `9999px` radius is `--radius-badge` and the genuinely
circular switch track/knob, which is the sanctioned carve-out.

### ⚠️ The `--el-*` layer is re-declared inside the dark block, and it has to be

A custom property is substituted at the element it is **declared** on. An
`--el-*` declared only on `:root` therefore computes against `:root`'s
`--color-*`, and a nested element that flips `--color-*` inherits the
already-resolved LIGHT value. Panel 10 rendered white until the `--el-*` layer
was re-declared inside `[data-theme='dark']`. This costs nothing in the app —
`data-theme` lives on `<html>` there — but any multi-panel board that wants light
and dark in ONE export needs it, and the next such asset in this folder should
copy the pattern rather than rediscover it.

### Copy strings (en — new keys for 8.13.5 / 8.13.6)

Both UI cards ship `en` + `zh` together; `tests/i18n-catalog.test.ts` enforces
the parity, so a missing `zh` twin is a red build.

- Pane title **"Security"**; org subtitle **"Sign-in requirements for everyone in
  {org}."**, workspace subtitle **"Sign-in requirements for everyone in
  {workspace}."**
- Card title (both tiers) **"Require two-factor authentication"**.
- Org body **"Everyone in this organization signs in with a second factor. Nobody
  is signed out and nobody is removed — the next time a person opens Motir they
  are asked to set one up, and any method counts: a passkey, an authenticator app
  or email codes."**
- Workspace body **"Additionally require a second factor for everyone in this
  workspace. Your organization's setting applies on top of this one and cannot be
  lowered here."**
- State labels **"Not required"** / **"Required for every member of {org}"** /
  **"Required for every member of {workspace}"**.
- Locked pill **"Required by {org}"**.
- Locked explanation (org mandates, workspace does not) **"{org} requires
  two-factor authentication for every member, so it cannot be switched off for
  this workspace. An owner or admin of {org} can change it in the organization's
  Security settings."**
- Locked explanation (BOTH) **"This workspace requires two-factor
  authentication, and so does {org}. Turning off the organization's requirement
  will leave this workspace's own requirement in place."**
- Refusal **"You don't have access to this"** / **"Only an owner or an admin of
  {org} can change its security settings. Ask one of them if this needs to
  change."**
- Menu / rail row label **"Security"**.
- Switch `aria-label` **"Require two-factor authentication"** — the switch is a
  bare control and announces nothing without it.

**No copy implies a deadline.** Rung 1 is explicit that neither Atlassian nor
GitHub ships a grace period or a countdown, so nothing here says "by" or
"within".

### ⚠️ Planning flags

1. **The rail row is gated and its neighbours are not**, which reads as an
   inconsistency to anyone who does not know §6d. 8.13.6's acceptance criteria
   already carry the `notFound()` requirement; the RAIL half is this asset's, and
   the comment beside it in `SidebarNav.tsx` should say why this row differs from
   Job runs and Git or the next reader will "fix" it.
2. **The org pane has no refusal ROUTE of its own.** Panel 8 refuses the CARD
   inside a rendered pane, matching how `settings/organization/page.tsx` gates
   per section rather than per page. If 8.13.5 instead makes the whole route
   404 for a non-admin, that is a different decision from the one drawn here and
   should be taken deliberately, not by accident.
3. **Nothing here draws a member LIST.** "Who is not yet compliant?" is a
   reasonable next question for an admin who has just switched this on, and this
   story does not answer it. Not a gap in 8.13 — a candidate for a later card,
   named so it is not smuggled into 8.13.5.

# The org menu gains a `Git` row (Story MOTIR-4669 · subtask MOTIR-4673)

**2026-09-05.** The git connect surface moves to the ORGANISATION tier, and **a surface with no
drawn entrance gets its entrance improvised at build time.** This amendment draws the entrance. It
is `org-admin.mock.html` **Panel 6**, and it decides one thing: where the row goes and what gates it.

**It does not describe the page behind it.** That is **MOTIR-4672**, `design/github/` Panel 6 —
the organisation's repository inventory, its index states, its `Used by N projects` column and its
disconnect disclosure. Cited here, described nowhere.

---

## ⚠️ AMENDMENT (2026-09-05, same day) — THE DOOR WAS STILL NOT VISIBLE. PANEL 7.

Panel 6 answers _"where does the row go"_ and it answers it correctly, but it answers a smaller
question than the card is for. Yue, on reading it:

> now organization → setting goes to a single page with left nav setting highlighted, the same
> setting nav as the project setting. you didn't make it clear in the design where the door is

Verified, and true. The rail's bottom `Settings` row points at `/settings/organization` whenever
there is no active project (`SidebarNav.tsx`, the area door). You arrive at a single page of cards,
the bottom `Settings` row is lit, and there is **nothing on the page that names `Git`** — or
`Members`, or `Security`, or `Usage`. The org menu is a pop-over you must already know to open, it
closes behind you, and it highlights nothing. So the menu row is a real door and it is not a
findable one.

**The decision (Yue): organisation settings gains a real settings nav** — the registry-driven rail
`settings/project/` and `settings/account/` each already have. That is **Panel 7**, and it changes
what this card's two superseded sections below concluded. Panel 6's row is kept: it is the FAST
door, and it is how `Members` and `Billing` have always been reached.

### Panel 7, arm by arm

| arm    | draws                                                                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **7a** | the area shell with `Git` active — the chrome around MOTIR-4672's pane, which is what was missing |
| **7b** | `Organisation` active: today's index page, card for card, inside the same chrome — nothing moves  |
| **7c** | the two filtered arms — a plain org member, and an org admin on a self-host build                 |
| **7d** | the registry, row by row: group · id · route · glyph · who sees the row                           |

### The registry

A sibling of `lib/settings/projectSettingsNav.ts` and `lib/settings/accountSettingsNav.ts`, with the
same `{ id, group, href, icon, labelKey, exact? }` entry shape and the same
`SETTINGS_NAV_GROUP_ORDER` discipline.

| group     | id             | route                             | glyph         | who sees the row                           |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `general` | `organization` | `/settings/organization` (exact)  | `Building2`   | any org member — §6d gates it per SECTION  |
| `general` | `git`          | `/settings/organization/git`      | `GitBranch`   | any org member; WRITE controls owner/admin |
| `access`  | `members`      | `/settings/organization/members`  | `Users`       | org owner/admin                            |
| `access`  | `security`     | `/settings/organization/security` | `ShieldCheck` | org owner/admin                            |
| `billing` | `usage`        | `/settings/organization/usage`    | `Coins`       | org owner/admin                            |
| `billing` | `billing`      | `/settings/organization/billing`  | `CreditCard`  | org owner/admin, **cloud builds only**     |

**Groups mirror the two existing rails' shape** (`general / access / work / automation`;
`general / preferences / security / data`) and land on `general / access / billing`. `Git` sits in
`general` for the same reason the project rail puts `repositories` there: it is the tenant's own
resources, not a permission and not money.

**Two filter axes, both already precedented** by `visibleSettingsNav(held, NAV, availability)`:
what the actor HOLDS (org owner/admin vs plain member) and what this BUILD has (`billing` is
cloud-only, exactly as the org menu already gates it). A group with no surviving rows is not
rendered — no empty heading, no disabled row.

### The index row is called `Organisation`, not `Settings`

The word the org menu uses for the same route is `Settings`. Inside a settings area a row named
"Settings" names its own container; the project rail has the same row and calls it `Details`. The
MENU keeps its word — it is outside the area, where "Settings" is what the destination is. **Every
other label is the menu's, in full**: `Usage & cost`, `Billing & plans`, not truncated to fit a
rail. Two doors onto one room that disagree about its name are two rooms to the person using them.

### ⚠️ NOTHING MOVES — and `WorkspaceFoldInSection` in particular

The four existing sub-routes become rows; the index becomes the `Organisation` row; `Git` is the one
NEW row. No page's content changes. In particular **`WorkspaceFoldInSection` stays on the index
page**: below the workspace-tier reveal that page hosts two tiers' sections (`organization-tier.md`
§6d), and relocating them is a §6 decision this card has no business re-taking. The row filter
decides which ROWS exist; the index page keeps its own per-SECTION gating, unchanged.

### ⚠️ THE PREREQUISITE NOTHING IN THE PLAN BUILDS

`/settings/organization/*` has no area layout, no nav registry, and no `SidebarNav` branch. Panel 7
specifies all three, and **no subtask under MOTIR-4669 builds them** — MOTIR-4680 assumes the page
exists inside an area. This is surfaced as a planning proposal rather than absorbed here; a design
card may specify a prerequisite, it may not quietly grow one.

---

## ⚠️ SUPERSEDED BY THE AMENDMENT ABOVE — kept as the reading that produced Panel 6

### There is no org settings RAIL — this menu IS the navigation

`/settings/organization/*` has **no area layout and no settings rail**. `settings/project/` and
`settings/account/` each have one; the organisation does not. Its navigation is the **org menu**
behind the organisation name (`app/(authed)/_components/OrgControl.tsx`), plus the command palette.

So the row lands in the menu, and this asset already owns that menu (Panel 1, arm C). It is also why
**MOTIR-4672's Panel 6 draws its page with no rail beside it** — the two halves agree about what the
navigation is, which is the whole point of splitting the door from the room.

> **Every FACT above is still true of the shipped tree; the inference was not.** A tier that is the
> only one of three without a settings nav is a **gap**, and answering "where does the Git row go"
> with "the pop-over, because that is all there is" designs the gap in permanently. Panel 7 builds
> the rail. MOTIR-4672's Panel 6 gains it too.

## The convention that was read, and where the row goes

**Read from the SHIPPED menu, not from this asset's own Panel 1.** The shipped rows are
`Settings` · `Security` · `Members` · `Usage & cost` · `Billing & plans` (cloud-only), a separator,
then `New workspace` / `Switch organization`. Each is a lucide glyph at `--el-icon-muted` plus a
label.

**`Git` sits third — after `Security`, above `Members`.** The shipped menu's own reasoning for
`Security` is that it sits directly under `Settings` because it is _a settings-shaped destination_
and keeping it above `Members` _holds the two account-level concerns together_. `Git` is the third
such concern — the organisation's own resources — so it joins that block rather than landing among
the people and money rows. The menu then reads **configuration → people → money**, which is the
order it already had.

**The glyph and the word are the ones the row already had.** `git-branch`, labelled `Git` — the same
pair it carried in the shell rail's bottom section. It is the SAME row arriving, and drawing it with
a new glyph would hide that.

**One width.** The menu is a popover of a single fixed width (288px shipped, drawn at 300px as
Panel 1 draws it), so "every width the asset draws" is one — unlike a rail, which this is not.

## ⚠️ CORRECTED — the gate is ORG MEMBERSHIP on the ROW, owner/admin on the WRITES

This section first read _"the gate: ORG ADMIN, and the row is ABSENT when it is not held"_, and both
arms were drawn that way. **That was wrong**, and wrong in a way §6 of
`docs/decisions/organization-tier.md` names outright:

> a hidden tier may not remove a capability … relocating a surface preserves its gate. If the
> destination admits fewer actors than the source, the destination's gate is what must change — not
> the set of people who can act.

The surface this row relocates FROM is `/settings/workspace/github`. Read at `HEAD`: it checks a
session and a workspace context and **no role at all** — every workspace member reads it today. And
every workspace member is an org member, by §5's upward invariant. Admin-gating the row would have
taken a shipped capability away silently, which is the exact failure §6 was written to prevent.

**So: the row is org-membership-gated, and the owner/admin gate belongs on the page's WRITE controls
— Connect · Disconnect · Remove.** Panel 6 arm B and Panel 7c both draw it that way now.

**What survives from the first drawing is the DISPOSITION**, unchanged and still right for the rows
it applies to: **absent, not disabled**, because an entry point is a promise about a room and a
disabled row is a promise the product then refuses (MOTIR-2468). It is what `Billing & plans` does
off cloud and `Security` does below the workspace-tier reveal.

**⚠️ A consequence for MOTIR-4672, recorded not designed here.** If any org member can read the
inventory, the `Used by N projects` column can name a project the viewer may not browse. The count
and the expansion must read the SAME access-filtered set — never a count that reveals a project the
viewer cannot name. Noted on that asset; the column is drawn there.

## ⚠️ Panel 1's menu is a POINT-IN-TIME RECORD and stays as drawn

Panel 1 arm C draws the org menu as it stood when this asset was written —
`Settings · Members · Billing & usage (Coming soon) · New workspace`. The product has since added
`Security` and `Usage & cost` and made `Billing` active and cloud-conditional. **Panel 1 is not
amended**: bringing it up to date is a change to what that panel records and is not this card's
work. **But the new row is not drawn into it either** — a row placed by a convention read from a
stale list would be placed by nothing. Hence a second panel, drawn from the shipped menu, saying so
in its own label.

## The departure half — MOTIR-4640, and the two agree

The row LEAVES the shell rail's bottom section: **MOTIR-4640**, in `design/shell/`, which removes it
from `rail-bottom-section.mock.html` and narrows that section's floor to `Job runs` alone. **The two
are halves of one move and they agree about the destinations**, which MOTIR-4640 states as three:

| what leaves the rail row          | where it arrives                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| the host connection's lifecycle   | **Settings → Organisation → Git** — the surface this row opens (MOTIR-4672) |
| the member's own git account      | Settings → Account → Git accounts (MOTIR-4675)                              |
| which repositories a project uses | Settings → Project → Repositories, which already exists (MOTIR-4674)        |

This asset's row is the first of those three. **Cited, not restated:** what any of those surfaces
contains belongs to the card that draws it.

## Primitives and token roles

| Element          | Primitive                                | Colour role                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The menu         | the shipped `Popover` + `ul role="list"` | `--el-page-bg` / `--el-border` / `--shadow-elevated`, `--radius-card`          |
| The row          | `MenuLink`                               | `--el-text`, `--radius-control`, `--spacing-control-x/y`                       |
| The row's glyph  | lucide `GitBranch`                       | `--el-icon-muted`                                                              |
| The menu heading | the existing `menu-head`                 | `--el-text-muted` on the white popover (4.54:1 — AA-safe there and only there) |

**Nothing new is introduced.** No new primitive, no new token, no new affordance — one row, in a
menu that already renders five.

**⚠️ The row is drawn AT REST, with no `.active`.** That class paints `--el-surface`, on which the
row glyph's `--el-text-muted` measures 4.17:1 and fails AA (`tests/design-ink-contrast.test.ts`
rules on it) — and a menu row is only active while the pointer is on it, which is not what this
panel is about.

## Explicitly OUT of scope here

- **What the org Git page contains** — MOTIR-4672, `design/github/` + `design/gitlab/` Panels 6–7.
- **The rail row's removal** — MOTIR-4640, `design/shell/`. Cited as the departure; not performed here.
- **The project's `Add repository` picker** — MOTIR-4674, `design/repository-set/`.
- **The member's own git credential and its account-nav row** — MOTIR-4675, `design/settings/`.
- **Bringing Panel 1's menu up to date** — a change to what that panel records, and not this card's.
- **BUILDING the org settings nav** — Panel 7 specifies it; no subtask under MOTIR-4669 builds it,
  and it is surfaced as a planning proposal rather than absorbed here.
- **Moving `WorkspaceFoldInSection`, or anything else off the index page** — a §6d decision, and
  Panel 7's whole claim is that nothing moves.
